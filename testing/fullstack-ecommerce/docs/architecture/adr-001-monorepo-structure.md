# ADR-001: Monorepo Structure for Fullstack E-Commerce Platform

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to organize a fullstack e-commerce application with Django backend and React frontend. The decision is between a monorepo approach or separate repositories for backend and frontend.

## Decision
We will use a **monorepo structure** with clear separation between backend and frontend codebases.

### Structure:
```
├── backend/          # Django REST API
├── frontend/         # React SPA
├── infrastructure/   # Docker & K8s configs
├── docs/            # Shared documentation
```

## Rationale

### Advantages:
1. **Unified Versioning**: Single source of truth for project version
2. **Atomic Changes**: Backend API changes can be deployed with matching frontend updates
3. **Simplified CI/CD**: Single pipeline can test and deploy both services
4. **Shared Documentation**: Architecture decisions apply to entire system
5. **Developer Experience**: Clone once, develop across stack

### Trade-offs:
1. **Build Complexity**: Need separate build processes for backend/frontend
2. **Deployment Coordination**: Must handle independent deployment of services
3. **Repository Size**: Larger codebase in single repo

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Easier to maintain API contracts between backend and frontend
- Simplified dependency management across stack
- Better code discoverability for fullstack developers

### Negative:
- Requires careful CI/CD configuration to avoid building unchanged services
- Need clear documentation on which team owns which directories

## Compliance
This structure enables AIPM to:
- Detect Django, React, PostgreSQL, Docker plugins simultaneously
- Create work items spanning backend + frontend implementation
- Establish dependencies between API development and UI implementation
- Track complete feature lifecycle from backend to frontend
