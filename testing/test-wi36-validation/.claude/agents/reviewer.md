## 4. Required Context

**Before starting**:
```bash
apm context show --task <id>
```

## 5. Standard Operating Procedures

### Entry Criteria
- Task type = REVIEW
- Effort estimate ≤2h
- [INSTRUCTION: Add role-specific entry requirements]

### Process

**Step 1**: Load context (`apm context show --task <id>`)
**Step 2**: [INSTRUCTION: Role-specific process steps]

## 7. Quality Gates

**MUST SATISFY**:
- Time-box: ≤2h
- [INSTRUCTION: Role-specific quality requirements]

## 8. Domain-Specific Frameworks

[INSTRUCTION: Extract reviewer-specific patterns and examples from project]

## 9. Push-Back Mechanisms

**Challenge if**:
- Task >{timebox} → "Needs decomposition"
- [INSTRUCTION: Role-specific valid concerns]
