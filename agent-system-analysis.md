### Performance Analysis

#### Current Performance Issues
1. **TaskStart Hook: 145ms** (Target: <100ms)
   - Database queries: 65ms (45% of total time)
   - Plugin facts: 20ms (could be cached)
   - Agent SOP loading: 10ms per agent
   - Context assembly: 50ms

2. **Agent Validation: 30ms per task**
   - File system checks for agent existence
   - Registry validation overhead
   - Cache misses in agent lookup

3. **Workflow Complexity: 7 critical friction points**
   - Hardcoded pytest execution blocks non-code testing
   - Overly broad coverage gates block config/doc testing
   - Broken AC verification blocks R1_REVIEW phase
   - Manual AC construction required for every task
   - No metadata templates for different task types

### Complexity Analysis

#### Over-Engineering Issues
1. **Excessive Agent Count**: 85 agents for a project management system
2. **Complex Orchestration**: 3-tier system with multiple delegation layers
3. **Redundant Responsibilities**: Multiple agents with overlapping functions
4. **High Maintenance Burden**: Each agent requires 10-20KB of SOP documentation

#### Workflow Friction Points
1. **P0 Critical Issues**:
   - Hardcoded pytest execution blocks non-code testing
   - Overly broad coverage gates block config/doc testing
   - Broken AC verification blocks R1_REVIEW phase

2. **P1 High Impact Issues**:
   - Manual AC construction required for every task
   - No metadata templates for different task types
   - Two parallel workflows (validate-based vs phase-based) is confusing
   - Task validation requires work item to be 'ready' first

3. **P2 Medium Impact Issues**:
   - Cryptic error messages
   - No interactive tutorials
   - Complex escalation paths when gates fail

## Recommendations

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (2-3 weeks)
1. Fix the 3 P0 workflow blockers
2. Improve error messages
