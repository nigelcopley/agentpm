## Key Findings Summary

### Current State Assessment
- **Package Configuration**: ✅ Excellent (pip-installable, clean)
- **Database Initialization**: ✅ Robust (automatic migrations)
- **Framework Detection**: ✅ Good (smart defaults, plugin system)
- **Post-Init Workflow**: ❌ **FRAGMENTED** (3 commands, not 1)
- **User Guidance**: ⚠️ Incomplete (unclear next steps)
- **Error Handling**: ⚠️ Masked failures (graceful degradation)

### Primary Problem
**Users must run 3 separate commands to reach a usable state:**
```bash
apm init "Project"          # Creates database only
apm agents generate --all   # Required but presented as optional
apm work-item create "Task" # Finally ready to work
```

**Impact**:
- Time to first work item: 8-10 minutes (target: <3 min)
- Required commands: 3 (target: 1)
- User clarity: ~60% (target: 95%)

### Root Cause
No orchestration layer connecting database setup → detection → rules → agents

### Recommended Fix
Create **InitOrchestrator** service that auto-chains all setup phases
- Effort: 6-8 hours
- Impact: 80% reduction in init friction
- Unblocks future improvements

---

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 days)
Improve visibility and clarity without major refactoring
- Improve help text
- Auto-verify after init
- Better preset semantics
- Emphasize critical path
- **Impact**: 30% friction reduction
- **Effort**: 4.5-6.5 hours

### Phase 2: Critical (3-4 days)
Create orchestration layer and auto-chain setup
- Create InitOrchestrator service
- Auto-bundle agent generation
- Stage-based initialization
- **Impact**: 80% friction reduction
- **Effort**: 12-17 hours

### Phase 3: Polish (2-3 days)
Enhanced UX and error handling
- Interactive wizard
- Better error messages
- Scenario templates

### Phase 4: Advanced (3-4 days)
Nice-to-have features
- Cleanup/rollback
- Diagnostics
- Advanced options
