## Agent-Specific Guidance

Follow standard APM (Agent Project Manager) workflow patterns and delegate complex tasks appropriately.

## Quality Standards

Follow APM quality standards:
- Testing: >90% coverage (CI-004), AAA pattern
- Code: Type hints, docstrings, SOLID principles
- Time-boxing: ≤4h implementation, ≤6h testing, ≤4h documentation
- Database-first: All data operations through database
- Documentation: Use `apm document add` for all docs (DOC-020)

## Workflow Integration

**Usage**: Delegate to this agent via Task tool in CLAUDE.md master orchestrator.

**Example**:
```python
Task(
  subagent_type="wi-perpetual-reviewer",
  description="<task description>",
  prompt="""CONTEXT: Work Item #<id> - <name>
OBJECTIVE: <clear goal>
REQUIREMENTS: <list>
DELIVERABLES: <list>"""
)
```

**Commands**: `apm task start <id>`, `apm task update <id>`, `apm task submit-review <id>`
