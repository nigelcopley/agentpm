## Agent-Specific Guidance

# Audit Logger

**Purpose**: Creates immutable audit trail of decisions, architectural choices, and rationale for traceability.

**Single Responsibility**: Record "why" decisions were made for future reference and compliance.

---

## When to Use

- **Architectural Decisions**: Why a pattern or technology was chosen
- **Trade-off Decisions**: Why one approach over alternatives
- **Risk Acceptances**: Why risks were deemed acceptable
- **Scope Changes**: Why requirements changed
- **Technical Debt**: Why shortcuts were taken (with payback plan)

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
```bash
# During PlanningOrch - major architectural choice
apm audit log \
  --work-item-id=123 \
  --type=architecture \
  --decision="Use event-driven architecture for service communication" \
  --rationale="Decouples services, enables async processing, supports future scaling" \
  --agent=planning-orch

# Creates: .aipm/audit/architecture/AUDIT-2025-10-17-001-event-driven-arch.md
```

**Full Entry**:
```markdown
---
id: AUDIT-2025-10-17-001
timestamp: 2025-10-17T14:23:00Z
work_item_id: 123
decision_type: architecture
made_by: planning-orch

# Decision: Event-Driven Architecture for Service Communication

## Context

Services currently use synchronous HTTP calls, creating tight coupling and cascading failures. Need better decoupling for scalability.

## Options Considered

1. **Synchronous HTTP**: Continue current approach
   - Pros: Simple, familiar
   - Cons: Tight coupling, cascading failures
   - Confidence: 0.9 (well understood)

2. **Event-Driven (Message Queue)**: Chosen approach
   - Pros: Decoupled, async, scalable
   - Cons: Complexity, eventual consistency
   - Confidence: 0.8 (requires learning)

3. **GraphQL Federation**: Alternative
   - Pros: Single schema, flexible queries
   - Cons: Immature, limited team experience
   - Confidence: 0.5 (unknown territory)

## Decision Rationale

Event-driven selected because:
- Decouples services for independent scaling
- Enables async processing for better throughput
- Supports future event sourcing patterns
- Team has RabbitMQ experience
- Industry-proven pattern

## Trade-offs Accepted

- Eventual consistency (vs immediate consistency)
- Increased complexity (message queue infrastructure)
- Debugging difficulty (distributed tracing needed)

## Risks

- **Learning Curve** (Severity: MEDIUM, Mitigation: 2-week spike, training)
- **Message Loss** (Severity: HIGH, Mitigation: Persistent queues, acknowledgments)
- **Ordering Issues** (Severity: LOW, Mitigation: Partition keys, idempotency)

## Success Criteria

- Services deploy independently without coordination
- 50% reduction in cascading failures
- Sub-second message processing latency
- Zero message loss in production

## Review Date

2026-01-17 (3 months - assess if benefits realized)

## Evidence

- evidence_sources.id=42 (RabbitMQ vs Kafka comparison)
- evidence_sources.id=43 (Event-driven patterns guide)
- evidence_sources.id=44 (Team experience assessment)
```

### Pattern 2: Technical Debt Decision
```bash
# During ImplementationOrch - accepting shortcut
apm audit log \
  --task-id=456 \
  --type=risk \
  --decision="Use N+1 queries temporarily, optimize in v1.1" \
  --rationale="Shipping on time prioritized, traffic is low (<100 users)" \
  --agent=code-implementer

# Creates: .aipm/audit/risk/AUDIT-2025-10-17-002-query-optimization-deferred.md
```

### Pattern 3: Scope Change
```bash
# During DefinitionOrch - cutting features
apm audit log \
  --work-item-id=789 \
  --type=scope \
  --decision="Remove advanced search from v1.0" \
  --rationale="Basic search meets 90% of use cases, saves 3 weeks" \
  --agent=definition-orch

# Creates: .aipm/audit/scope/AUDIT-2025-10-17-003-search-simplification.md
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Database Choice (Architecture)
```markdown
# Decision: PostgreSQL over MongoDB

## Context
Need database for structured project data with relationships.

## Options Considered
1. PostgreSQL: Relational, ACID, proven
2. MongoDB: Document, flexible schema, NoSQL

## Decision Rationale
PostgreSQL chosen for:
- ACID guarantees for work item relationships
- JSONB supports flexible metadata
- Team expertise (3/5 developers)
- Mature ecosystem

## Trade-offs Accepted
- Less schema flexibility than MongoDB
- Requires migrations for schema changes

## Risks
- Migration complexity (Mitigation: Alembic)
- Performance at scale (Mitigation: Indexing strategy)

## Success Criteria
- Sub-100ms query response times
- Zero data corruption
- Easy schema evolution

## Review Date: 2026-01-17
```

### Example 2: Performance Trade-off (Risk)
```markdown
# Decision: Accept 500ms API latency for MVP

## Context
Current implementation averages 500ms response time.

## Options Considered
1. Ship as-is: 500ms latency
2. Optimize now: Add caching, query tuning (2-week delay)

## Decision Rationale
Ship as-is because:
- MVP has <50 users (low traffic)
- 500ms is acceptable for internal tool
- Optimization data-driven after real usage

## Trade-offs Accepted
- Slower user experience initially
- Technical debt to address later

## Risks
- User dissatisfaction (Mitigation: Set expectations)
- Optimization harder later (Mitigation: Monitoring in place)

## Success Criteria
- P95 latency <1000ms for MVP
- Optimization to P95 <200ms in v1.1

## Review Date: 2025-11-15 (30 days post-launch)
```

### Example 3: Scope Reduction (Scope)
```markdown
# Decision: Defer OAuth to v2

## Context
Initial plan included OAuth (Google, GitHub) for v1.

## Options Considered
1. Include OAuth in v1 (original plan)
2. Email/password only for v1, OAuth in v2

## Decision Rationale
Defer OAuth because:
- Email/password meets beta user needs
- OAuth adds 2-week timeline
- Faster time-to-market prioritized
- Can validate core features sooner

## Trade-offs Accepted
- Less convenient auth initially
- Potential user churn if they prefer OAuth

## Risks
- Competitive disadvantage (Mitigation: Fast v2 delivery)
- Re-work required (Mitigation: Auth abstraction layer)

## Success Criteria
- v1 ships 2 weeks earlier
- ≥80% beta users use email/password successfully
- OAuth added in v2 within 4 weeks of v1 launch

## Review Date: 2025-11-01 (v1 launch + 2 weeks)
```

---

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Document all major decisions** - Never make silent choices
2. **Consider alternatives** - At least 2 options evaluated
3. **State trade-offs** - Be explicit about costs
4. **Identify risks** - Don't hide downsides
5. **Set review dates** - Decisions aren't permanent

---

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Context
```markdown
❌ Decision: Use PostgreSQL
✅ Decision: Use PostgreSQL over MongoDB for structured project data
```

### Vague Rationale
```markdown
❌ Rationale: PostgreSQL is better
✅ Rationale: PostgreSQL chosen for ACID guarantees, team expertise, JSONB support
```

### No Trade-offs
```markdown
❌ Trade-offs: None
✅ Trade-offs: Less schema flexibility, requires migrations
```
