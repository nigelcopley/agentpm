"""
Test Other Blueprint Routes (Research, Sessions, Contexts, Projects, Ideas, Search)

Tests for refactored routes covering remaining blueprints:
- research.py: Evidence sources, events, documents
- sessions.py: Session management
- contexts.py: Context management
- projects.py: Project operations
- ideas.py: Ideas management
- search.py: Search functionality

Acceptance Criteria Validation:
1. All routes follow consistent RESTful naming patterns
2. No route overlap between blueprints
3. Clear separation of concerns
4. All existing functionality preserved
