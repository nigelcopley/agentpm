"""
Test Configuration Blueprint Routes (Rules, Agents, Settings)

Tests for refactored configuration.py routes covering:
- Rules list and detail views
- Agents list and detail views
- Project settings routes

Acceptance Criteria Validation:
1. All routes follow consistent RESTful naming patterns
2. No route overlap with other blueprints
3. Clear separation - configuration blueprint handles rules/agents/settings only
4. All existing functionality preserved
