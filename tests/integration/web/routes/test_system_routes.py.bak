"""
Test System Blueprint Routes (Health, Metrics, Workflow)

Tests for refactored system.py routes covering:
- System health monitoring
- Database metrics and statistics
- Workflow visualization
- System information

Acceptance Criteria Validation:
1. All routes follow consistent RESTful naming patterns
2. No route overlap with other blueprints
3. Clear separation - system blueprint handles health/metrics only
4. All existing functionality preserved
