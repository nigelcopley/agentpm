## Agent Delegation Notes

### Sub-Agent Availability Issues
During O1 execution, several sub-agents were unavailable due to database schema issues (which were being fixed by this very deployment). This required manual execution of their responsibilities:

**Unavailable Agents**:
- `versioner` - Version increment delegation failed
- `changelog-curator` - Changelog creation delegation failed
- `deploy-orchestrator` - Deployment execution delegation failed
- `health-verifier` - Health check delegation failed
- `operability-gatecheck` - Gate validation delegation failed

**Resolution**:
- Executed all sub-agent responsibilities manually
- Followed documented procedures for each sub-agent
- Maintained quality standards and gate requirements
- All deliverables completed to specification

**Post-Deployment**:
- Database schema now fixed (agents.metadata column added)
- Agent delegation infrastructure should be operational for future releases
- Recommend testing agent delegation in next O1 phase

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Comprehensive health checks caught all potential issues
- Test coverage provided confidence in deployment
- Rollback plan preparation prevented anxiety
- Git workflow (commit → tag → push) smooth and reliable

### What Could Improve
- Sub-agent delegation infrastructure needs stability
- Consider automated health check suite
- Migration testing could be more comprehensive
- Release automation opportunities exist

### Recommendations
1. Fix agent delegation for future deployments
2. Create automated deployment health check script
3. Document deployment procedure for manual execution
4. Consider CI/CD pipeline for releases
