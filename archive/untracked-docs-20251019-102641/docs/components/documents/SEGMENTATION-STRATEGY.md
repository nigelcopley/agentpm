## ðŸš€ **Segmentation Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Subcategory-Based Segmentation**

Create subcategories within each main category:

```
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ planning/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ functional/          # Functional requirements
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ non-functional/      # Non-functional requirements
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ security/            # Security requirements
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ performance/         # Performance requirements
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ business/            # Business requirements
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ analysis/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ market-research/     # Market research
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ competitive/         # Competitive analysis
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ feasibility/         # Feasibility studies
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ stakeholder/         # Stakeholder analysis
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ specifications/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ technical/           # Technical specifications
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ functional/          # Functional specifications
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ interface/           # Interface specifications
â”œâ”€â”€ processes/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ workflows/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ business/            # Business workflows
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ technical/           # Technical workflows
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deployment/          # Deployment workflows
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ incident-response/   # Incident response workflows
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ procedures/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ development/         # Development procedures
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ testing/             # Testing procedures
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ deployment/          # Deployment procedures
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ maintenance/         # Maintenance procedures
â””â”€â”€ architecture/
    â”œâ”€â”€ design/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ system/              # System design
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ database/            # Database design
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/                 # API design
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ security/            # Security design
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ performance/         # Performance design
    â””â”€â”€ patterns/
        â”œâ”€â”€ design-patterns/     # Design patterns
        â”œâ”€â”€ architectural-patterns/ # Architectural patterns
        â””â”€â”€ anti-patterns/       # Anti-patterns
```

### **Strategy 2: Metadata-Driven Segmentation**

Use metadata fields to segment within flat directories:

```
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ planning/requirements/       # Flat directory
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user-authentication-requirements.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ payment-processing-requirements.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ reporting-requirements.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ security-requirements.md
â”œâ”€â”€ processes/workflows/         # Flat directory
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user-onboarding-workflow.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deployment-workflow.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ incident-response-workflow.md
â””â”€â”€ architecture/design/         # Flat directory
    â”œâ”€â”€ system-architecture.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ database-design.md
    â””â”€â”€ api-design.md
```

**Database Metadata:**
```python
# Requirements segmentation
{
    "document_type": "requirements",
    "category": "planning",
    "subcategory": "functional",  # functional, non-functional, security, performance, business
    "component": "auth",          # auth, payment, reporting, etc.
    "tags": ["security", "authentication", "user-management"]
}

# Workflow segmentation
{
    "document_type": "workflow",
    "category": "processes",
    "subcategory": "business",    # business, technical, deployment, incident-response
    "component": "onboarding",    # onboarding, deployment, code-review, etc.
    "tags": ["user-management", "automation"]
}
```

### **Strategy 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**

Combine subcategories for major segments with metadata for fine-grained segmentation:

```
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ planning/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ functional/          # Major segment: functional requirements
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ non-functional/      # Major segment: non-functional requirements
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ security/            # Major segment: security requirements
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ analysis/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ market-research/     # Major segment: market research
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ competitive/         # Major segment: competitive analysis
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ feasibility/         # Major segment: feasibility studies
â”œâ”€â”€ processes/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ workflows/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ business/            # Major segment: business workflows
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ technical/           # Major segment: technical workflows
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ deployment/          # Major segment: deployment workflows
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ procedures/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ development/         # Major segment: development procedures
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ testing/             # Major segment: testing procedures
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ deployment/          # Major segment: deployment procedures
â””â”€â”€ architecture/
    â”œâ”€â”€ design/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ system/              # Major segment: system design
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ database/            # Major segment: database design
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api/                 # Major segment: API design
    â””â”€â”€ patterns/
        â”œâ”€â”€ design-patterns/     # Major segment: design patterns
        â””â”€â”€ architectural-patterns/ # Major segment: architectural patterns
```

**Enhanced Metadata:**
```python
class DocumentReference(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields ...
    
    # Segmentation fields
    category: str                    # planning, architecture, guides, etc.
    subcategory: Optional[str] = None # functional, non-functional, business, technical, etc.
    component: Optional[str] = None   # auth, payment, database, api, etc.
    domain: Optional[str] = None      # security, performance, scalability, etc.
    tags: Optional[List[str]] = None  # Flexible tagging
    
    # Examples:
    # Requirements: category="planning", subcategory="functional", component="auth"
    # Workflow: category="processes", subcategory="business", component="onboarding"
    # Design: category="architecture", subcategory="system", component="database"
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Segmentation Rules**

### **When to Use Subcategories vs Metadata**

#### **Use Subcategories When:**
- **Clear Major Segments**: Distinct types that are commonly separated
- **High Volume**: Many documents of each type
- **Different Audiences**: Different stakeholders for each segment
- **Different Lifecycles**: Different review/approval processes

**Examples:**
- `requirements/functional/` vs `requirements/non-functional/`
- `workflows/business/` vs `workflows/technical/`
- `design/system/` vs `design/database/`

#### **Use Metadata When:**
- **Fine-Grained Segmentation**: Many small segments
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Same document type across multiple domains
- **Flexible Filtering**: Need to filter by multiple dimensions
- **Dynamic Segmentation**: Segments change frequently

**Examples:**
- Component-based: `auth`, `payment`, `reporting`
- Domain-based: `security`, `performance`, `scalability`
- Tag-based: `user-management`, `automation`, `compliance`

---

## ðŸš€ **Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Identify Major Segments**

Analyze each category to identify natural major segments:

```python
SEGMENTATION_RULES = {
    "planning": {
        "requirements": ["functional", "non-functional", "security", "performance", "business"],
        "analysis": ["market-research", "competitive", "feasibility", "stakeholder"],
        "specifications": ["technical", "functional", "interface"]
    },
    "processes": {
        "workflows": ["business", "technical", "deployment", "incident-response"],
        "procedures": ["development", "testing", "deployment", "maintenance"],
        "standards": ["coding", "documentation", "security", "performance"]
    },
    "architecture": {
        "design": ["system", "database", "api", "security", "performance"],
        "patterns": ["design-patterns", "architectural-patterns", "anti-patterns"],
        "integration": ["api-integration", "data-integration", "service-integration"]
    },
    "guides": {
        "user": ["getting-started", "advanced", "troubleshooting"],
        "developer": ["setup", "development", "testing", "deployment"],
        "admin": ["installation", "configuration", "maintenance", "troubleshooting"]
    },
    "reference": {
        "api": ["rest", "graphql", "websocket", "grpc"],
        "runbooks": ["deployment", "incident-response", "maintenance", "backup"],
        "configuration": ["environment", "database", "services", "security"]
    }
}
```

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Document Types**

Add subcategory-aware document types:

```python
class DocumentType(str, Enum):
    # Requirements with subcategories
    FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS = "functional_requirements"     # â†’ docs/planning/requirements/functional/
    NON_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS = "non_functional_requirements" # â†’ docs/planning/requirements/non-functional/
    SECURITY_REQUIREMENTS = "security_requirements"         # â†’ docs/planning/requirements/security/
    PERFORMANCE_REQUIREMENTS = "performance_requirements"   # â†’ docs/planning/requirements/performance/
    BUSINESS_REQUIREMENTS = "business_requirements"         # â†’ docs/planning/requirements/business/
    
    # Workflows with subcategories
    BUSINESS_WORKFLOW = "business_workflow"                 # â†’ docs/processes/workflows/business/
    TECHNICAL_WORKFLOW = "technical_workflow"               # â†’ docs/processes/workflows/technical/
    DEPLOYMENT_WORKFLOW = "deployment_workflow"             # â†’ docs/processes/workflows/deployment/
    INCIDENT_RESPONSE_WORKFLOW = "incident_response_workflow" # â†’ docs/processes/workflows/incident-response/
    
    # Design with subcategories
    SYSTEM_DESIGN = "system_design"                         # â†’ docs/architecture/design/system/
    DATABASE_DESIGN = "database_design"                     # â†’ docs/architecture/design/database/
    API_DESIGN = "api_design"                               # â†’ docs/architecture/design/api/
    SECURITY_DESIGN = "security_design"                     # â†’ docs/architecture/design/security/
    PERFORMANCE_DESIGN = "performance_design"               # â†’ docs/architecture/design/performance/
    
    # ... other types
```

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Placement Rules**

```python
def get_document_path(document_type: DocumentType, title: str, subcategory: str = None) -> str:
    """Generate document path with subcategory support."""
    
    # Base type mapping
    base_mapping = {
        DocumentType.FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS: "planning/requirements/functional",
        DocumentType.NON_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS: "planning/requirements/non-functional",
        DocumentType.SECURITY_REQUIREMENTS: "planning/requirements/security",
        DocumentType.BUSINESS_WORKFLOW: "processes/workflows/business",
        DocumentType.TECHNICAL_WORKFLOW: "processes/workflows/technical",
        DocumentType.SYSTEM_DESIGN: "architecture/design/system",
        DocumentType.DATABASE_DESIGN: "architecture/design/database",
        # ... other mappings
    }
    
    # Get base directory
    directory = base_mapping.get(document_type, "reference/other")
    
    # Add subcategory if provided and not already in path
    if subcategory and subcategory not in directory:
        directory = f"{directory}/{subcategory}"
    
    filename = _slugify(title) + ".md"
    return f"docs/{directory}/{filename}"
```
