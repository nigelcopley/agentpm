# Comprehensive Universal Document System - 90% Use Case Coverage

**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Comprehensive Design - 90% Use Case Coverage  
**Context**: Expanded universal document system covering all major project types

---

## 🎯 **Analysis: Current vs Required Coverage**

### **Current Structure Analysis**
Our current 4-category structure covers basic needs but misses several important use cases:

**Current Categories:**
- `planning/` - Project planning and analysis
- `architecture/` - System design and technical specifications  
- `guides/` - User and developer documentation
- `reference/` - API docs, troubleshooting, runbooks

**Gaps Identified:**
- **Process Documentation**: Workflows, procedures, standards
- **Compliance & Governance**: Policies, audits, certifications
- **Project Management**: Roadmaps, milestones, retrospectives
- **Operations**: Monitoring, incident response, maintenance
- **Research & Analysis**: Market research, competitive analysis, feasibility studies
- **Training & Onboarding**: Learning materials, knowledge transfer
- **Communication**: Meeting notes, announcements, status updates
