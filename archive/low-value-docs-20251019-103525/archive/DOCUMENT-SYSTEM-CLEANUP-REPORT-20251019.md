# Document System Cleanup - Final Report

**Date**: 2025-10-19 10:26
**Executor**: file-operations-agent

## Cleanup Summary

### Phase 1: Root Directory Archive ✅
- Created archive: `archive/audit-reports-20251019-102439/`
- Archived 8 audit/analysis reports
- Root directory now contains only: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, CLAUDE.md, NEXT-SESSION.md

### Phase 2: Database Cleanup ✅
- Database backup created: `.aipm/data/aipm.db.backup-20251019-102XXX`
- Removed 14 code files (.py, .j2) from document registry
- Removed 1 test file (bad.md) from registry
- Removed 11 orphaned records (files that no longer exist)

### Phase 3: Category Migration ✅
- Moved 4 files from invalid categories to valid ones:
  - docs/components/agents/architecture/* → docs/architecture/agents/architecture/
  - docs/components/agents/guides/* → docs/architecture/agents/guides/
  - docs/migrations/other/* → docs/communication/migrations/
- Updated database records with new paths
- Removed empty invalid category directories

### Phase 4: Untracked Documents Archive ✅
- Created archive: `archive/untracked-docs-20251019-102641/`
- Archived files from invalid category paths:
  - docs/components/
  - docs/migrations/
  - docs/artifacts/
- Preserved directory structure in archive
- Removed now-empty invalid category directories

## Final Verification

### Database Statistics
- **Total records**: 50
- **Invalid categories**: 0 ✅
- **Code files in DB**: 0 ✅
- **Orphaned records**: 0 ✅

### Root Directory
- **Markdown files (excluding exceptions)**: 0 ✅

### Category Breakdown
```
architecture:    16 files
guides:           5 files
planning:         3 files
testing:          1 files
other (valid):   25 files (communication, governance, operations, tests, etc.)
```

### Valid "Other" Categories
The "other" category includes legitimate paths:
- docs/communication/ (migration docs, session summaries)
- docs/governance/ (quality gates, reports)
- docs/operations/ (runbooks, progress reports)
- tests/ (test documentation)
- Root files: CHANGELOG.md, agentpm/web/README.md

## Success Criteria - Met ✅

- ✅ Root directory: Only README.md, CHANGELOG.md, CLAUDE.md, NEXT-SESSION.md
- ✅ Invalid categories: 0
- ✅ Code files in DB: 0
- ✅ Orphaned records: 0
- ✅ All untracked docs from invalid paths: Archived with structure preserved
- ✅ Database: Clean and valid

## Notes

### Untracked Files
There are 238 markdown files in the docs/ directory that exist on filesystem but are not registered in the document_references table. These files are in VALID category paths (docs/design/, docs/analysis/, docs/specifications/, etc.) and are not causing system issues.

**Recommendation**: These files should be reviewed and either:
1. Registered in the document system using `apm document register`
2. Archived if obsolete
3. Left untracked if they are design artifacts not meant for the document system

This is a separate concern from the cleanup task and should be handled as a future work item.

### Archives Created
1. **archive/audit-reports-20251019-102439/** - Audit reports from root directory
2. **archive/untracked-docs-20251019-102641/** - Untracked files from invalid categories

Both archives include MANIFEST.md files explaining their contents and retention policy (30 days).

## Conclusion

The document system cleanup is **COMPLETE**. All success criteria have been met:
- Invalid category paths removed
- Code files removed from document registry
- Orphaned records cleaned up
- Root directory cleaned
- Database is valid and consistent

The system is now in a clean, valid state ready for normal operations.
