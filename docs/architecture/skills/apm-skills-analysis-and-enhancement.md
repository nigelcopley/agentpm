# APM Skills: Analysis & Enhancement Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the APM (Agent Project Manager) APM Commands Skill against Anthropic's official best practices for Claude Code skills, as documented in their engineering blog post "Equipping Agents for the Real World with Agent Skills" and the official anthropics/skills repository.

**Current State**: The APM Commands Skill (1,050 lines, single SKILL.md file) is well-designed and follows most Anthropic best practices. It provides comprehensive coverage of all 20 APM (Agent Project Manager) commands with 7 practical workflow examples, 10 troubleshooting scenarios, and clear integration with the database-driven architecture.

**Alignment Assessment**: Strong alignment with core principles (proper frontmatter, clear triggers, appropriate tool permissions, reference integration) with opportunities for enhancement in progressive disclosure (file splitting), executable helpers (Python/Bash scripts for deterministic operations), and enhanced metadata (machine-readable metadata.json).

**Key Recommendations**:
1. **Maintain current implementation** - already production-ready and follows best practices
2. **Add metadata.json** (quick win) - better tooling integration
3. **Implement progressive disclosure** (medium term) - split into modular structure for context window optimization
4. **Add executable helpers** (advanced) - deterministic command generation and validation scripts

The skill can be deployed immediately in its current form and enhanced iteratively based on real-world usage patterns, perfectly aligning with Anthropic's "start with evaluation" philosophy.

## Official Anthropic Skills Framework

### Design Philosophy (from Engineering Blog)

Anthropic's engineering post "Equipping Agents for the Real World with Agent Skills" outlines four key design principles:

#### 1. Progressive Disclosure

**Three-Level Information Hierarchy**:
- **Metadata layer**: Names and descriptions in system prompt (always loaded)
- **Core documentation**: Loads when skill is activated (SKILL.md)
- **Supplementary resources**: Loads selectively based on task needs (supporting files)

**Benefits**:
- Optimizes context window usage
- Faster skill activation
- More efficient token consumption
- Better scalability as skills grow

**Implementation Pattern**:
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md           # 300-600 lines: Core activation logic
├── reference.md       # Detailed reference material
├── examples.md        # Extended examples
└── troubleshooting.md # Diagnostic guides
```

#### 2. Structure for Scale

**Separation of Concerns**:
- Keep SKILL.md focused on activation and routing
- Separate mutually exclusive contexts into different files
- Use supporting files for specialized content
- Maintain single responsibility per file

**Size Guidelines**:
- SKILL.md: Target 300-600 lines for fast loading
- Supporting files: No hard limit, but maintain focus
- Total skill size: No restriction, but prioritize modular structure

#### 3. Executable Code Integration

**Bundled Scripts**:
- Include Python/Bash scripts for deterministic operations
- Use scripts for repetitive, token-intensive tasks
- Leverage programmatic execution over token generation
- Ensure security and validation in bundled code

**Benefits**:
- Faster response times (no token generation)
- More reliable outputs (deterministic vs probabilistic)
- Reduced context window pressure
- Better performance for structured tasks

**Example Use Cases**:
- Command validation and generation
- State machine validation
- Complex calculations
- Data transformations

#### 4. Development Best Practices

**Iterative Approach**:
1. **Start with evaluation**: Identify gaps in current capabilities
2. **Adopt Claude's perspective**: Monitor how skills are actually used
3. **Iterate based on patterns**: Enhance based on real usage data
4. **Security considerations**: Validate bundled code for safety

**Security Guidelines**:
- No external network calls without explicit consent
- Validate all inputs to bundled scripts
- Use safe practices (no eval, no unvalidated exec)
- Clear documentation of capabilities and limits

---

### Repository Patterns (from anthropics/skills)

The official anthropics/skills repository demonstrates several organizational patterns:

#### 1. File Structure Standards

**Required Components**:
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md           # Required: YAML frontmatter + instructions
```

**Optional Components**:
```
skill-name/
├── reference.md       # Optional: Detailed reference material
├── examples.md        # Optional: Extended examples
├── scripts/           # Optional: Executable helpers
│   └── helper.py
└── templates/         # Optional: Reusable templates
    └── template.txt
```

**SKILL.md Frontmatter**:
```yaml
---
name: Skill Name
description: Clear, concise description of skill purpose
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Bash
  - Grep
---
```

#### 2. Category Organization

Skills are organized by functional domain:

- **Creative & Design**: Image generation, UI design, presentations
- **Development & Technical**: Code review, testing, debugging
- **Enterprise & Communication**: Documentation, reports, emails
- **Meta Skills**: Skill management, capability discovery

**AIPM Categorization**: Development & Technical (Project Management subcategory)

#### 3. Document Skills Pattern (Advanced)

**Multi-Format Support**:
- Skills can include .docx, .pdf, .pptx, .xlsx as references
- Separate form-specific content into dedicated files
- Use document formats for complex templates and examples

**Example Structure**:
```
document-skill/
├── SKILL.md
├── template.docx      # Word template
├── examples.pdf       # Example outputs
└── reference.xlsx     # Data reference
```

**AIPM Application**: Could use JSON templates, example outputs, workflow diagrams

---

## Current APM Commands Skill Assessment

### Strengths

#### 1. Comprehensive Coverage

**Statistics**:
- **File size**: 1,050 lines (slightly above recommended 600-line threshold)
- **Command coverage**: All 20 APM (Agent Project Manager) commands documented
- **Workflow examples**: 7 practical scenarios covering common use cases
- **Troubleshooting**: 10 detailed diagnostic scenarios with solutions
- **Integration patterns**: Clear guidance on phase-based workflows, quality gates, time-boxing

**Content Quality**:
- Copy-pasteable command examples
- Clear explanations of command purpose and usage
- Comprehensive parameter documentation
- Real-world workflow patterns
- Integration with APM (Agent Project Manager) architecture

#### 2. Proper Frontmatter

**YAML Header**:
```yaml
name: APM Commands Assistant
description: Comprehensive APM V2 command reference and guidance
Triggers: "apm", "work-item", "task", "status", "context", "agent", "command help", "how do I"
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Grep
  - Glob
  - Bash
```

**Strengths**:
- Clear, descriptive name
- Comprehensive description of purpose
- Excellent trigger keywords for activation (8 distinct triggers)
- Appropriate tool permissions (Read for docs, Grep/Glob for search, Bash for commands)
- No unnecessary tool access (security best practice)

#### 3. Reference Integration

**Smart Strategy**:
- References authoritative quick reference: `docs/reference/apm-commands-quick-reference.md`
- Avoids duplication of detailed command syntax
- Uses Read tool to fetch current documentation on demand
- Maintains single source of truth for command details

**Implementation**:
```markdown
## Reference Documentation

### Quick Reference Document
The authoritative command reference is maintained at:
docs/reference/apm-commands-quick-reference.md

Always consult this document for:
- Complete command syntax
- All subcommand options
- Parameter details
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces skill file size
- Ensures accuracy (references live documentation)
- Easier maintenance (single source of truth)
- Better separation of concerns (skill logic vs reference data)

#### 4. AIPM-Specific Patterns

**Domain Knowledge Embedded**:

**Phase-Based Workflow**:
```
D1_DISCOVERY → P1_PLAN → I1_IMPLEMENTATION → R1_REVIEW → O1_OPERATIONS → E1_EVOLUTION
```

**Quality Gate Requirements**:
- D1 Gate: business_context ≥50 chars, AC≥3, risks≥1, 6W≥0.70
- P1 Gate: Tasks created, estimates complete, dependencies mapped
- I1 Gate: Tests updated, code complete, docs updated
- R1 Gate: AC verified, tests pass, quality checks pass

**Time-Boxing Guidance**:
- Implementation tasks: ≤4 hours (STRICT)
- Testing tasks: ≤6 hours (Recommended)
- Design tasks: ≤8 hours (Recommended)

**Database-First Emphasis**:
- Clear explanation that rules come from database, not files
- Emphasis on `apm rules list` as source of truth
- Proper understanding of runtime vs documentation files

---

### Areas for Enhancement

#### 1. File Size & Progressive Disclosure

**Current State**:
- Single SKILL.md file: 1,050 lines
- All content in one file (commands, examples, troubleshooting)
- Exceeds recommended 600-line threshold

**Opportunity**:
- Split into modular structure at ~600-line threshold
- Separate specialized content into supporting files
- Implement three-level information hierarchy

**Recommended Split**:
```
.claude/skills/apm-commands/
├── SKILL.md                    # 300-400 lines: Core guidance + activation
├── command-reference.md        # Detailed command syntax reference
├── workflow-patterns.md        # Extended workflow examples
├── troubleshooting.md          # Detailed troubleshooting guide
└── examples/                   # Practical examples library
    ├── feature-workflow.md
    ├── session-management.md
    └── quality-gates.md
```

**Benefits**:
- Faster skill activation (smaller SKILL.md loads first)
- Selective loading of detailed content (Read troubleshooting.md only when needed)
- Better context window utilization (only load relevant sections)
- Easier maintenance (update specific files without touching core logic)
- More scalable (can add new examples without bloating SKILL.md)

#### 2. Missing Executable Helpers

**Current State**:
- No bundled Python/Bash scripts
- All command generation via token generation
- No deterministic validation helpers

**Opportunity**:
- Add Python/Bash helpers for common operations
- Implement deterministic command generation
- Create workflow validation scripts

**Proposed Scripts**:

**scripts/validate-workflow.py**:
```python
"""
Validate current workflow state and suggest next actions.

Usage: Claude runs this to check if work item/task can advance.
Returns: Current phase, gate status, recommended next command
"""

def validate_workflow_state(entity_type: str, entity_id: int) -> dict:
    """Check current state and validate against gate requirements."""
    # Query database for current state
    # Validate gate requirements
    # Return structured response with:
    # - current_phase
    # - current_status
    # - gate_status (passed/failed)
    # - next_command (recommended action)
    # - blockers (list of issues)
    pass
```

**scripts/suggest-next-command.py**:
```python
"""
Analyze context and generate appropriate apm command.

Usage: Claude generates context-aware commands.
Returns: Ready-to-execute command with explanation
"""

def suggest_next_command(context: dict) -> dict:
    """Generate appropriate command based on current context."""
    # Analyze entity type, status, phase
    # Check gate requirements
    # Determine next logical action
    # Generate command with all required flags
    # Return:
    # - command (full command string)
    # - explanation (why this command)
    # - alternatives (other options)
    pass
```

**scripts/format-example.sh**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Format command examples with consistent style
# Validate syntax
# Add explanatory comments

format_example() {
    local command="$1"
    # Validate command syntax
    # Add comments explaining parameters
    # Format with consistent indentation
    # Return formatted, validated example
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces token generation for repetitive tasks (faster responses)
- Ensures command accuracy (deterministic vs probabilistic)
- Validates workflow state programmatically (no hallucination)
- Better performance (execution vs generation)
- More reliable assistance (consistent outputs)

#### 3. No Supporting Reference Files

**Current State**:
- Single monolithic file containing all content
- No separation between core logic and reference material
- Examples, troubleshooting, and commands all intermixed

**Opportunity**:
- Extract detailed content to dedicated reference files
- Implement progressive disclosure pattern
- Create specialized supporting documents

**Proposed Structure**:

**command-reference.md**:
```markdown
# APM Commands Detailed Reference

## Work Item Commands
### apm work-item create
- **Purpose**: Create new work item
- **Syntax**: `apm work-item create NAME [OPTIONS]`
- **Parameters**: ...
- **Examples**: ...
```

**workflow-patterns.md**:
```markdown
# APM Workflow Patterns

## Feature Development Lifecycle
[Detailed walkthrough of D1→P1→I1→R1→O1→E1]

## Session-Based Development
[Extended session management patterns]
```

**troubleshooting.md**:
```markdown
# APM Commands Troubleshooting Guide

## Database Errors
### Symptom: sqlite3.OperationalError
### Solutions: ...

## Gate Validation Failures
### Symptom: Gate requirements not met
### Solutions: ...
```

**Benefits**:
- SKILL.md stays focused on activation logic
- Supporting files loaded only when needed
- Easier to maintain and update specific areas
- Better organization for users browsing files
- Can add new patterns without bloating core skill

#### 4. Metadata Enhancement

**Current State**:
- YAML frontmatter only in SKILL.md
- No machine-readable metadata file
- Limited integration with AIPM tooling

**Opportunity**:
- Add metadata.json for better tooling integration
- Enable programmatic skill discovery and management
- Provide structured capability declaration

**Proposed metadata.json**:
```json

   - Command syntax query → Read command-reference.md
   - Workflow guidance → Read workflow-patterns.md
   - Troubleshooting → Read troubleshooting.md
   - Example request → Read examples/*.md

2. **Load relevant content**: Use Read tool for specific sections

3. **Provide context-aware guidance**: Combine loaded content with user context

4. **Reference authoritative sources**: Always cite docs/reference/apm-commands-quick-reference.md
```

**Expected Results**:
- SKILL.md activation: ~50% faster (400 vs 1,050 lines)
- Context window usage: ~60% reduction on simple queries
- Maintenance: Easier to update specific areas
- Scalability: Can add examples without bloating core

**Effort**: 3-4 hours (split content, update routing logic, test activation)

---

### Priority 2: Executable Helpers (Medium Impact)

**Goal**: Provide deterministic command generation and validation

**Implementation Plan**:

**Phase 1: Workflow Validation Script**

**scripts/validate-workflow.py**:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Validate workflow state and suggest next actions.

Usage:
    python validate-workflow.py --type work-item --id 123
    python validate-workflow.py --type task --id 456

Output:
    JSON with current state, gate status, and next recommended command
"""

import argparse
import json
import sqlite3
from pathlib import Path

def get_db_path() -> Path:
    """Locate .aipm/aipm.db relative to project root."""
    # Implementation details
    pass

def validate_work_item_state(db: sqlite3.Connection, work_item_id: int) -> dict:
    """Validate work item against current phase gate requirements."""
    # Query current state
    # Check gate requirements
    # Determine next action
    return {
        "entity_type": "work_item",

    }

def validate_task_state(db: sqlite3.Connection, task_id: int) -> dict:
    """Validate task state and suggest next action."""
    # Similar to work_item validation
    pass

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Validate workflow state")
    parser.add_argument("--type", choices=["work-item", "task"], required=True)
    parser.add_argument("--id", type=int, required=True)
    args = parser.parse_args()

    db_path = get_db_path()
    db = sqlite3.connect(db_path)

    if args.type == "work-item":
        result = validate_work_item_state(db, args.id)
    else:
        result = validate_task_state(db, args.id)

    print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Phase 2: Command Suggestion Script**

**scripts/suggest-next-command.py**:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Analyze context and suggest next command.

Usage:
    python suggest-next-command.py --work-item 123
    python suggest-next-command.py --task 456

Output:
    Recommended command with explanation
"""

        "explanation": "All P1 gate requirements met, ready to enter I1_IMPLEMENTATION",
        "alternatives": [
            {
                "command": "apm work-item phase-validate 123 --phase=P1_PLAN",

    }

def main():
    # Implementation similar to validate-workflow.py
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Phase 3: Example Formatter Script**

**scripts/format-example.sh**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Format and validate command examples

set -euo pipefail

format_example() {
    local command="$1"
    local context="$2"

    # Validate command syntax (basic check)
    if ! echo "$command" | grep -q "^apm "; then
        echo "ERROR: Invalid command format (must start with 'apm')" >&2
        return 1
    fi

    # Add explanatory comments
    echo "# Context: $context"
    echo "# Command:"
    echo "$command"
    echo ""
    echo "# Expected output:"
    echo "# [Command execution results]"
}

# Usage
format_example "apm work-item create 'Feature' --type=feature" "Create new feature work item"
```

**Phase 4: Integration with SKILL.md**

Update skill to use scripts:

```markdown
## Command Generation

When generating commands for users:

1. **Validate current state**:
   ```bash
   python .claude/skills/apm-commands/scripts/validate-workflow.py \
     --type work-item --id 123
   ```

2. **Generate recommendation**:
   ```bash
   python .claude/skills/apm-commands/scripts/suggest-next-command.py \
     --work-item 123
   ```

3. **Format example**:
   ```bash
   bash .claude/skills/apm-commands/scripts/format-example.sh \
     "apm work-item next 123" "Advance work item to next state"
   ```
```

**Expected Results**:
- Command generation: ~70% faster (execution vs token generation)
- Accuracy: 100% (deterministic script vs probabilistic generation)
- Validation: Programmatic gate checking (no hallucination)
- Consistency: Standardized command format and explanation

**Effort**: 6-8 hours (script development, testing, integration, documentation)

---

### Priority 3: Enhanced Metadata (Low Impact, High Value)

**Goal**: Better integration with AIPM tooling and skill management

**Implementation Plan**:

**Phase 1: Create metadata.json**

Create `.claude/skills/apm-commands/metadata.json` with comprehensive skill metadata:

```json

**Phase 2: Integrate with AIPM Tooling**

Update `apm skills` commands to use metadata.json:

```python
# agentpm/core/skills/methods.py

def show_skill_details(skill_name: str) -> dict:
    """Show detailed skill information from metadata.json."""
    metadata_path = f".claude/skills/{skill_name}/metadata.json"
    if Path(metadata_path).exists():
        with open(metadata_path) as f:
            return json.load(f)
    # Fallback to SKILL.md parsing
```

**Phase 3: Usage Tracking**

Implement usage tracking to populate `usage_statistics`:

```python
def track_skill_activation(skill_name: str, query: str, success: bool):
    """Track skill usage for optimization."""
    metadata_path = f".claude/skills/{skill_name}/metadata.json"
    with open(metadata_path, 'r+') as f:
        metadata = json.load(f)
        metadata['usage_statistics']['activation_count'] += 1
        # Update success rate, common queries, etc.
        f.seek(0)
        json.dump(metadata, f, indent=2)
```

**Expected Results**:
- Better skill discovery via `apm skills list-skills`
- Version tracking and changelog visibility
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Usage analytics for iterative improvement
- Machine-readable capability declaration

**Effort**: 1-2 hours (create metadata.json, integrate with apm commands, test)
