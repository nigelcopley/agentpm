# Agent-Driven Impact Analysis Specification

## Executive Summary

The Agent-Driven Impact Analysis Specification defines a systematic approach where **AI agents themselves** analyze, plan, and implement work items as system changes with full awareness of their potential impacts across all system dimensions. This specification transforms APM (Agent Project Manager) from a simple task management system into a comprehensive change management platform where agents perform thorough impact analysis through **gated phases**.

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
The Agent-Driven Impact Analysis system ensures that every work item is implemented safely without breaking existing functionality by:
- **Requiring agents to identify** all potential impacts before implementation
- **Requiring agents to assess** risks and develop mitigation strategies
- **Requiring agents to create** appropriate tasks based on identified impacts
- **Requiring agents to validate** all impacts are properly addressed
- **Enabling safe deployment** with rollback capabilities through agent-driven planning

### 1.2 Scope
This specification covers:
- **Agent-driven** impact analysis methodology and frameworks
- **Agent-driven** risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- **Agent-driven** task creation based on impacts
- **Agent-driven** comprehensive validation frameworks
- **Agent-driven** special handling for continuous work item types
- Integration with existing APM (Agent Project Manager) workflow system through **gated phases**

### 1.3 Key Principles
- **Agent-Driven Analysis**: AI agents must identify and assess every potential impact
- **Gated Phases**: Each phase must be completed before proceeding to the next
- **Evidence-Based Validation**: Agents must provide evidence for all analysis and validation
- **Stakeholder-Centric**: Agents must identify and align all affected stakeholders
- **Safety-First**: Agents must plan safe implementation with rollback capabilities
