## Section Placement Strategy

The Universal Rules section was intelligently inserted:

1. **Before terminal sections**: Prohibited Actions, Non-Negotiables, Examples
2. **After main content**: Responsibilities, Delegation Patterns, Operating Patterns
3. **Consistent position**: Same relative location in all agents for easy navigation

### Typical Structure
```markdown
[Front matter]
## Responsibilities
## [Agent-specific sections]
## Operating Pattern / Delegation Pattern

---

## 🚨 Universal Agent Rules (MANDATORY)
[Rule 1: Summary Creation]
[Rule 2: Document References]
[Validation Checklist]

## [Final sections: Prohibited, Non-Negotiables, Examples]
```

---

## Validation Performed

### Automated Checks
- ✅ All 50 files contain "Universal Agent Rules (MANDATORY)"
- ✅ Section includes Rule 1 (Summary Creation)
- ✅ Section includes Rule 2 (Document References)
- ✅ Validation checklist present in all files
- ✅ Reference to UNIVERSAL-AGENT-RULES.md included

### Manual Spot Checks
- ✅ Orchestrator sample: planning-orch.md - correctly positioned
- ✅ Sub-agent sample: code-implementer.md - correctly positioned
- ✅ Utility sample: evidence-writer.md - correctly positioned
- ✅ Formatting consistent across all samples
- ✅ Content accurate and complete

---

## Summary Types Reference

Embedded in all agents:

**Work Item**: `work_item_progress`, `work_item_milestone`, `work_item_decision`
**Task**: `task_completion`, `task_progress`, `task_technical_notes`
**Project**: `project_status_report`, `session_progress`
**Session**: `session_handover`

---

## Document Types Reference

Embedded in all agents:

`requirements`, `design`, `architecture`, `adr`, `specification`, `test_plan`, `runbook`, `user_guide`

---

## Enforcement Mechanism

**R1 Gate** (Review Quality Gate) will validate:
1. Summary exists for entity worked on
2. Document references complete for all created/modified files
3. Summary includes required elements (what, decisions, next steps)

**Non-compliance**: Work cannot advance from REVIEW phase without meeting these obligations.

---

## Benefits Achieved

### For Agents
- ✅ Clear, mandatory obligations embedded in every agent
- ✅ Consistent workflow expectations across all agents
- ✅ Easy-to-follow command examples for summary/document operations
- ✅ Validation checklist prevents incomplete work

### For System
- ✅ Guaranteed audit trail via summaries
- ✅ Complete document traceability via references
- ✅ Context continuity across sessions
- ✅ Quality gate enforcement of obligations

### For Users
- ✅ Predictable agent behavior
- ✅ Complete work history and documentation
- ✅ Better handover between sessions
- ✅ Improved system transparency

---

## Conclusion

Universal Agent Rules have been successfully embedded in **all 50 agent definitions**. Every agent now has clear, mandatory obligations for:

1. Creating summaries after work completion
2. Adding/updating document references when creating/modifying files
3. Validating compliance before marking work complete

This ensures:
- Complete audit trail across all agent work
- Seamless context continuity between sessions
- Quality gate enforcement of documentation standards
- Predictable, traceable agent behavior

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PRODUCTION USE
