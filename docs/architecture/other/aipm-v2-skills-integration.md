# APM (Agent Project Manager) Skills Integration Design

## Overview

This document outlines the integration between APM (Agent Project Manager) and the Anthropic Skills system, enabling Claude to effectively use APM (Agent Project Manager) for comprehensive project management and development workflow orchestration.

## Background

### Anthropic Skills System
The [Anthropic Skills repository](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) provides a framework for creating skills that enhance Claude's capabilities. Skills are self-contained folders with:
- `SKILL.md` files with YAML frontmatter and markdown instructions
- Supporting scripts, examples, and resources
- Standardised metadata and structure

### APM (Agent Project Manager) Current System
APM (Agent Project Manager) currently provides:
- 15 domain-agnostic agent templates
- Project-specific context injection
- Generated agents in `.claude/agents/` directory
- Workflow compliance and quality gates

## Integration Strategy

### 1. APM (Agent Project Manager) Skill Creation

**Primary Skill**: `aipm-v2-project-manager`
- **Purpose**: Teach Claude how to use APM (Agent Project Manager) effectively
- **Format**: Follows Anthropic Skills standard with YAML frontmatter
- **Content**: Comprehensive APM (Agent Project Manager) usage guide with examples

**Structure**:
```
aipm-v2-skill/
├── SKILL.md                    # Main skill definition
├── README.md                   # Skill overview and usage
├── examples/
│   └── basic-usage.md         # Practical examples
└── scripts/
    ├── setup-aipm.sh          # Project setup script

## Technical Implementation

### Skill Generation Integration

#### Current APM (Agent Project Manager) Agent Generation
```python
# Current system generates agents from templates
def generate_agents(project_context):
    for template in agent_templates:
        agent = fill_template_with_context(template, project_context)
        write_agent_to_claude_directory(agent)
```

#### Enhanced System with Skills
```python
# Enhanced system generates both agents and skills
def generate_agents_and_skills(project_context):
    # Generate traditional agents
    agents = generate_agents(project_context)
    
    # Generate project-specific APM (Agent Project Manager) skill
    skill = generate_aipm_skill(project_context)
    write_skill_to_claude_directory(skill)
    
    return agents, skill
```

### Project-Specific Skill Generation

#### Template-Based Approach
```python
def generate_aipm_skill(project_context):
    """Generate project-specific APM (Agent Project Manager) skill"""
    
    # Load base skill template
    base_skill = load_skill_template("aipm-v2-project-manager")
    
    # Inject project-specific context
    skill_content = inject_project_context(base_skill, project_context)
    
    # Add project-specific examples
    examples = generate_project_examples(project_context)
    skill_content = add_examples(skill_content, examples)
    
    # Add project-specific commands
    commands = generate_project_commands(project_context)
    skill_content = add_commands(skill_content, commands)
    
    return skill_content
```

#### Context Injection
```python
def inject_project_context(skill_content, project_context):
    """Inject project-specific context into skill"""
    
    # Replace placeholders with project-specific content
    skill_content = skill_content.replace(
        "[PROJECT_NAME]", project_context.get("name", "Project")
    )
    
    skill_content = skill_content.replace(
        "[TECH_STACK]", format_tech_stack(project_context.get("tech_stack", []))
    )
    
    skill_content = skill_content.replace(
        "[FRAMEWORKS]", format_frameworks(project_context.get("frameworks", []))
    )
    
    return skill_content
```

### Skill Metadata Enhancement

#### Dynamic Metadata Generation
```python
def generate_skill_metadata(project_context):
    """Generate dynamic skill metadata based on project context"""
    
    return {
        "name": f"aipm-v2-{project_context.get('name', 'project').lower().replace(' ', '-')}",
        "description": f"APM (Agent Project Manager) Project Manager for {project_context.get('name', 'Project')} - {project_context.get('description', 'Intelligent project management')}",
        "project_context": {
            "tech_stack": project_context.get("tech_stack", []),
            "frameworks": project_context.get("frameworks", []),
            "database": project_context.get("database", "Unknown"),
            "testing": project_context.get("testing_frameworks", [])
        }
    }
```

## Usage Scenarios
