**Implementation Example:**
```python
# Django monolith structure
myapp/
├── models/          # Data layer
├── views/           # Business logic
├── templates/       # Presentation layer

### 5. Microservices + Serverless

**Description:** Core services remain long-lived; bursty or peripheral capabilities run as functions to curb operational load.

**When to Use:**
- Mixed workload patterns
- Cost optimisation
- Operational simplicity
- Event-driven processing

**Implementation Strategy:**
```python
# Hybrid microservices + serverless
services/
├── user-service/      # Long-running service
├── order-service/     # Long-running service
└── functions/        # Serverless functions
    ├── image-processor/
    ├── email-sender/
    └── report-generator/
```

**Benefits:**
- Cost optimisation
- Operational simplicity
- Elastic scaling
- Mixed deployment models

---

### 6. Modular Monolith + CQRS/Event Sourcing

**Description:** Single codebase yet read/write segregation and event history give scalability and auditability without distributed ops.

**When to Use:**
- High read/write ratio
- Audit requirements
- Event history needs
- Single deployment preference

**Implementation Strategy:**
```python
# CQRS with modular monolith
modules/
├── user_management/
│   ├── commands/     # Write operations
│   ├── queries/      # Read operations
│   └── events/       # Event store
└── shared/
    ├── event_store/
    └── read_models/
```

**Benefits:**
- Read/write optimisation
- Event history
- Audit trail
- Single deployment

---

### 7. Microservices + Space-Based Grid

**Description:** Services keep ownership boundaries; shared in-memory data grid smooths spike handling and reduces cross-service latency.

**When to Use:**
- High-performance requirements
- Latency-sensitive applications
- Scalability spikes
- Distributed caching needs

**Implementation Strategy:**
```python
# Microservices with data grid
services/
├── user-service/      # Owns user data
├── order-service/     # Owns order data
└── grid/             # Shared data grid
    ├── cache/
    ├── replication/
    └── processing/
```

**Benefits:**
- High performance
- Low latency
- Service boundaries
- Scalability

---

### 8. Component-Based + Layered

**Description:** Reusable components organised by layers give both encapsulation and clear dependency rules, ideal for large teams.

**When to Use:**
- Large development teams
- Component reuse needs
- Clear team structure
- Enterprise applications

**Implementation Strategy:**
```python
# Component-based layered architecture
layers/
├── presentation/      # UI components
├── business/         # Business components
├── data/            # Data components
└── shared/          # Common components
```

**Benefits:**
- Component reuse
- Clear team boundaries
- Layered structure
- Parallel development

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Pattern Selection Process

1. **Assess Team Size and Skills**
   - Small teams (1-10): Monolith, Modular Monolith
   - Medium teams (10-30): Hexagonal, Clean Architecture
   - Large teams (30+): Microservices, SOA

2. **Evaluate Complexity Requirements**
   - Simple CRUD: Monolith, Layered
   - Complex business logic: Hexagonal, Clean Architecture
   - High scalability: Microservices, Event-Driven

3. **Consider Operational Constraints**
   - Limited ops team: Monolith, Serverless
   - Mature ops team: Microservices, Event-Driven
   - Cloud-native: Cloud-Native, Serverless

### 2. Migration Strategies

**Monolith to Modular Monolith:**
1. Identify module boundaries
2. Extract modules with clear interfaces
3. Enforce dependency rules
4. Gradually decouple modules

**Modular Monolith to Microservices:**
1. Ensure clean module boundaries
2. Extract modules as services
3. Implement service communication
4. Handle data consistency

**Layered to Hexagonal:**
1. Identify domain logic
2. Create ports for external dependencies
3. Implement adapters
4. Move business logic to domain layer

### 3. Testing Strategies

**Monolith Testing:**
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for module interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows

**Microservices Testing:**
