## 1. Architecture and Components

The Migration System is built on a **three-layer architecture** that separates concerns and provides clean abstractions for different migration types.

### Key Components:
- **`agentpm/core/database/migrations/manager.py`**: Central `MigrationManager` class that orchestrates migration discovery, execution, and rollback with transaction safety.
- **`agentpm/core/database/migrations/loader.py`**: `MigrationLoader` class responsible for discovering and importing migration files from the filesystem.
- **`agentpm/core/database/migrations/registry.py`**: `MigrationRegistry` class that tracks applied migrations in the `schema_migrations` table.
- **`agentpm/core/database/migrations/files/`**: Directory containing 18+ migration files with versioned schema evolution.
- **`agentpm/core/migrations/migrate_rules.py`**: V1 rules migration script for migrating `_RULES/*.md` files to V2 database.
- **`agentpm/core/migrations/v1_detection.py`**: V1 legacy file detection and migration guidance system.

**Three-Layer Architecture**:
- **Manager Layer**: Orchestrates migration execution, validation, and rollback with transaction safety
- **Loader Layer**: Discovers and imports migration files, validates module structure
- **Registry Layer**: Tracks applied migrations, manages version history, handles rollbacks

## 2. Database Migration System

The database migration system provides comprehensive schema evolution capabilities with enum-driven constraint generation.

### Key Features:
- **Versioned Migrations**: 18+ migration files (`migration_0001.py` to `migration_0038.py`) with sequential versioning
- **Enum-Driven Schema**: `migration_0018.py` creates complete schema using Pydantic enums for CHECK constraints
- **Transaction Safety**: All migrations wrapped in database transactions with automatic rollback on failure
- **Pre/Post Validation**: Optional `validate_pre()` and `validate_post()` functions for migration validation
- **Rollback Support**: Complete rollback capabilities with `downgrade()` functions and rollback tracking

**Migration File Structure**:
```python
# migration_0018.py example
def upgrade(conn: sqlite3.Connection) -> None:
    """Create complete APM (Agent Project Manager) database schema using enum helpers."""
    # Creates all tables with enum-driven CHECK constraints
    # Ensures database and code stay in sync

def downgrade(conn: sqlite3.Connection) -> None:
    """Rollback schema changes."""
    # Removes all tables and constraints
```

**Schema Evolution**: The system supports incremental schema changes with the consolidated `migration_0018.py` providing the complete APM (Agent Project Manager) schema, followed by specialized migrations for specific features.

## 3. V1-to-V2 Legacy Migration

The system provides comprehensive migration from V1 file-based systems to V2 database-driven architecture.

### Migration Components:
- **Rules Migration**: `migrate_rules.py` migrates `_RULES/*.md` files to the `rules` table with structured parsing
- **V1 Detection**: `v1_detection.py` detects legacy files and provides migration guidance
- **CLI Integration**: `apm migrate-v1-to-v2` command with dry-run, force, and validation options

**Rules Migration Process**:
```python
class RulesMigrator:
    def migrate(self, rules: List[Rule], dry_run: bool = False) -> bool:
        """Migrate rules to database with transaction safety."""
        # 1. Parse _RULES/*.md files for structured rules
        # 2. Extract rule ID, name, description, enforcement level
        # 3. Map to categories (CI, GR, DEV, CQ, TEST, DG, OP, WF, ARCH)
        # 4. Bulk insert with transaction safety and rollback
        # 5. Validate completeness and report statistics
```

**V1 Detection Features**:
- **File Pattern Detection**: Identifies V1 files (`_RULES/`, `STATUS.md`, `NEXT-SESSION.md`)
- **Migration Guidance**: Rich console output with migration benefits and commands
- **Performance Comparison**: Shows query time improvements (200-500ms → <10ms)

## 4. CLI Integration and Commands

The migration system provides comprehensive CLI integration with multiple commands for different migration scenarios.

### Available Commands:
- **`apm migrate`**: Run pending database migrations with list and validation options
- **`apm migrate-v1-to-v2`**: Complete V1-to-V2 migration with atomic 4-phase process
- **`apm document migrate-to-structure`**: Migrate documents to Universal Documentation System structure

**Migration Command Features**:
```bash
# Database migrations
apm migrate                    # Run all pending migrations
apm migrate --list             # Show pending migrations
apm migrate --show-applied     # Show applied migrations

# V1-to-V2 migration
apm migrate-v1-to-v2              # Interactive migration
apm migrate-v1-to-v2 --force      # Skip confirmation
apm migrate-v1-to-v2 --dry-run    # Preview only

# Document structure migration
apm document migrate-to-structure --dry-run    # Preview
apm document migrate-to-structure --execute    # Execute with backups
```

**Safety Features**:
- **Dry-run Mode**: Preview migrations without making changes
- **Transaction Safety**: Atomic operations with automatic rollback
- **Backup Creation**: Automatic backups before migration
- **Checksum Validation**: SHA-256 validation for file integrity
- **Confirmation Prompts**: Interactive confirmation for destructive operations

## 5. Error Handling and Recovery

The migration system implements robust error handling with comprehensive recovery mechanisms.

### Error Handling Features:
- **Fail-Fast Behavior**: Stops on first migration failure to prevent partial state
- **Transaction Rollback**: Automatic rollback on any error during migration
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: Comprehensive error messages with context
- **Migration Chain Validation**: Validates migration chain integrity and version sequence
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Complete rollback capabilities with reason tracking

**Error Recovery Process**:
```python
def run_all_pending(self) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Execute all pending migrations with fail-fast behavior."""
    for migration in pending:
        try:
            self.run_migration(migration)
            success_count += 1
        except MigrationError:
            failure_count += 1
            # Fail-fast: stop on first failure
            break
    return success_count, failure_count
```

**Validation Features**:
- **Migration Chain Integrity**: Checks for gaps in version sequence
- **File Existence**: Verifies all applied migrations have corresponding files
- **Module Validation**: Validates migration modules have required functions
- **Pre/Post Validation**: Optional validation hooks for migration safety

## 6. Performance and Scalability
