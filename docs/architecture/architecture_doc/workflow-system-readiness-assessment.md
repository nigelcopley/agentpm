## Architecture Analysis

### 1. Workflow Management System Overview

The workflow system implements a sophisticated **quality-gated state transition** architecture with the following key components:

#### Core Components:
- **WorkflowService**: Main coordinator for state transitions
- **PhaseProgressionService**: Manages phase advancement with gate validation
- **StateMachine**: Defines valid transitions and forbidden operations
- **Phase Gates**: 6 gate validators (D1, P1, I1, R1, O1, E1) with specific requirements
- **Type Validators**: Task type-specific quality gates and time-boxing
- **Agent Orchestrators**: 6 phase-specific orchestrator agents

#### Architecture Pattern:
```
User Request → WorkflowService → PhaseProgressionService → Gate Validators → State Updates
     ↓
Agent Orchestrators → Sub-Agents → Specialised Tasks → Quality Validation
```

### 2. Phase Progression System

#### 6-Phase Workflow (D1→P1→I1→R1→O1→E1):

**D1 Discovery Phase:**
- **Purpose**: Requirements gathering and scope definition
- **Gate Requirements**: business_context ≥50 chars, acceptance_criteria ≥3, risks ≥1, 6W confidence ≥0.70
- **Orchestrator**: `definition-orch` with 6-step delegation pattern
- **Status Mapping**: DRAFT

**P1 Planning Phase:**
- **Purpose**: Work breakdown and task decomposition
- **Gate Requirements**: Tasks created, estimates complete, dependencies mapped, mitigations planned
- **Orchestrator**: `planning-orch` with 6-step delegation pattern
- **Status Mapping**: READY

**I1 Implementation Phase:**
- **Purpose**: Code implementation and testing
- **Gate Requirements**: Tests updated, code complete, docs updated, migrations created
- **Orchestrator**: `implementation-orch` with 6-step delegation pattern
- **Status Mapping**: ACTIVE

**R1 Review Phase:**
- **Purpose**: Quality validation and acceptance
- **Gate Requirements**: AC verified, tests pass (100%), quality checks pass, code review approved
- **Orchestrator**: `review-test-orch` with quality validation
- **Status Mapping**: REVIEW

**O1 Operations Phase:**
- **Purpose**: Deployment and monitoring
- **Gate Requirements**: Version bumped, deployed, health checks pass, monitors active
- **Orchestrator**: `release-ops-orch` with deployment orchestration
- **Status Mapping**: DONE

**E1 Evolution Phase:**
- **Purpose**: Continuous improvement and learning
- **Gate Requirements**: Telemetry analyzed, improvements identified, feedback captured
- **Orchestrator**: `evolution-orch` with learning synthesis
- **Status Mapping**: ARCHIVED

### 3. Quality Gate System

#### Gate Validation Architecture:

**BaseGateValidator Pattern:**
```python
class BaseGateValidator(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def validate(self, work_item: WorkItem, db) -> GateResult:
        """
        Validate phase gate requirements.
        Returns GateResult with pass/fail and missing requirements.
        """
```

**GateResult Structure:**
```python
@dataclass
class GateResult:
    passed: bool
    missing_requirements: List[str]
    confidence: float  # 0.0-1.0 quality score
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
```

#### Quality Gate Enforcement:

**CI-001: Agent Validation**
- Valid, active agent assigned before task start
- Agent exists in registry and is not deprecated
- **Enforcement**: Block task → ACTIVE if agent invalid

**CI-002: Context Quality**
- Context confidence >70% before task start
- 6W completeness ≥70%, no stale contexts (>90 days)
- **Enforcement**: Block task → ACTIVE if context quality low

**CI-004: Testing Quality**
- Tests passing before review, acceptance criteria met before completion
- Coverage >90% for new code
- **Enforcement**: Block task → REVIEW/DONE if tests fail

**CI-006: Documentation Standards**
- Description ≥50 chars, business context defined
- No placeholder text (TODO, TBD, FIXME)
- **Enforcement**: Block work item transitions if documentation incomplete

### 4. State Machine Design

#### 6-State Unified Workflow:

**Forward Transitions:**
```python
WORK_ITEM_TRANSITIONS = {
    WorkItemStatus.DRAFT: [WorkItemStatus.READY, WorkItemStatus.CANCELLED],
    WorkItemStatus.READY: [WorkItemStatus.ACTIVE, WorkItemStatus.DRAFT],  # Can refine
    WorkItemStatus.ACTIVE: [WorkItemStatus.REVIEW, WorkItemStatus.BLOCKED],
    WorkItemStatus.BLOCKED: [WorkItemStatus.ACTIVE, WorkItemStatus.CANCELLED],
    WorkItemStatus.REVIEW: [WorkItemStatus.ACTIVE, WorkItemStatus.DONE],  # Can rework
    WorkItemStatus.DONE: [WorkItemStatus.ARCHIVED],
    WorkItemStatus.CANCELLED: [WorkItemStatus.ARCHIVED],
    WorkItemStatus.ARCHIVED: []  # Terminal
}
```

**Backward Transitions (Rework):**
- READY → DRAFT: Validation revealed issues, revise proposal
- REVIEW → ACTIVE: Review feedback requires rework
- BLOCKED → ACTIVE: Blocker unresolvable, task needs redesign

**Forbidden Transitions:**
- Cannot skip workflow stages (DRAFT → ACTIVE blocked)
- Cannot reopen completed work (DONE → ACTIVE blocked)
- Cannot skip review (ACTIVE → DONE blocked)

### 5. Multi-Agent Orchestration

#### Orchestrator Agent Architecture:

**6 Phase-Specific Orchestrators:**

1. **definition-orch** (D1 Discovery)
   - 6-step delegation pattern
   - Context assembly → Intent triage → Context assembly → AC writing → Risk analysis → Gate validation

2. **planning-orch** (P1 Planning)
   - 6-step delegation pattern
   - Work decomposition → Effort estimation → Dependency mapping → Mitigation planning → Backlog curation → Gate validation

3. **implementation-orch** (I1 Implementation)
   - 6-step delegation pattern
   - Pattern discovery → Code implementation → Test implementation → Migration authoring → Documentation updates → Gate validation

4. **review-test-orch** (R1 Review)
   - Quality validation orchestration
   - Test execution → Code review → Quality checks → Acceptance criteria verification

5. **release-ops-orch** (O1 Operations)
   - 6-step delegation pattern
   - Versioning → Changelog generation → Deployment → Health verification → Gate validation → Incident handling

6. **evolution-orch** (E1 Evolution)
   - 6-step delegation pattern
   - Signal harvesting → Insight synthesis → Debt registration → Refactoring proposals → Sunset planning → Gate validation

#### Delegation Pattern:
```
Orchestrator → Sub-Agents → Specialised Tasks → Quality Validation → Gate Progression
```

### 6. Type-Specific Workflow Management

#### Work Item Type Sequences:

**FEATURE** (Full lifecycle):
- D1 → P1 → I1 → R1 → O1 → E1
- All 6 phases required

**ENHANCEMENT** (Skip operations):
- D1 → P1 → I1 → R1 → E1
- Skip O1, go straight to evolution

**BUGFIX** (Minimal lifecycle):
- I1 → R1
- Skip discovery and planning phases

**RESEARCH** (No implementation):
- D1 → P1
- No implementation or operations phases

**PLANNING** (No implementation):
- D1 → P1
- No implementation or operations phases

#### Task Type Quality Gates:

**Time-Boxing Limits:**
```python
TASK_TYPE_MAX_HOURS = {
    TaskType.SIMPLE: 1.0,           # Quick tasks
    TaskType.REVIEW: 2.0,            # Code review
    TaskType.BUGFIX: 4.0,            # Bug fixes
    TaskType.IMPLEMENTATION: 4.0,    # STRICT - Forces decomposition
    TaskType.DEPLOYMENT: 4.0,
    TaskType.REFACTORING: 4.0,
    TaskType.TESTING: 6.0,
    TaskType.DOCUMENTATION: 6.0,
    TaskType.DESIGN: 8.0,
    TaskType.ANALYSIS: 8.0,
}
```

**Required Task Types Per Work Item:**
- FEATURE → {DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, TESTING, DOCUMENTATION}
- BUGFIX → {ANALYSIS, BUGFIX, TESTING}
- PLANNING → {ANALYSIS, DESIGN, DOCUMENTATION, REVIEW}
- RESEARCH → {ANALYSIS, DOCUMENTATION} (FORBIDS: IMPLEMENTATION, TESTING)
