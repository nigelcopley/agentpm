# ADR-013: Agent-Driven Impact Analysis Workflow System

## Status
**Proposed** - 2024-01-15

## Context

The current APM (Agent Project Manager) workflow system focuses primarily on task type validation and basic quality gates. However, work items represent system changes that can have far-reaching impacts across:

- **Code Dependencies**: APIs, interfaces, shared libraries
- **Database Schema**: Tables, migrations, data integrity
- **Configuration**: Environment variables, settings, feature flags
- **Infrastructure**: Deployment, scaling, monitoring
- **User Experience**: UI/UX workflows, accessibility
- **Business Processes**: Workflows, integrations, compliance
- **Performance**: Latency, throughput, resource usage
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, vulnerabilities

The current system lacks comprehensive impact analysis, leading to:
- Breaking changes being introduced without proper assessment
- Inadequate testing of integration points
- Poor stakeholder communication about impacts
- Insufficient risk mitigation strategies
- Lack of rollback procedures for complex changes

## Decision

We will implement an **Agent-Driven Impact Analysis Workflow System** that transforms work items from simple task validation into a complete change management system where **AI agents themselves** perform comprehensive impact analysis through **gated phases**.

### Core Components

#### 1. **Agent-Driven Phase Gates**
- **D1_DISCOVERY**: Agents must complete comprehensive dependency and impact analysis
- **P1_PLAN**: Agents must develop risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- **I1_IMPLEMENTATION**: Agents must create appropriate tasks based on their analysis
- **R1_REVIEW**: Agents must validate all impacts are properly addressed

#### 2. **Phase Gate Validation System**
```python
class PhaseGateValidator:
    """Validates agents have completed required analysis for each phase"""
    
    def validate_discovery_complete(self, work_item: WorkItem) -> ValidationResult:
        """Validate agent has completed comprehensive discovery analysis"""
        required_analysis = [
            "code_dependencies_identified",
            "database_impacts_assessed", 
            "integration_points_mapped",
            "user_workflow_impacts_analyzed",
            "business_process_impacts_evaluated",
            "performance_implications_assessed",
            "security_implications_evaluated"
        ]
        
        # Check if agent has provided evidence for each analysis area
        for analysis_type in required_analysis:
            if not work_item.metadata.get(f"discovery_{analysis_type}"):
                return ValidationResult(
                    is_valid=False,
                    error=f"Discovery incomplete: {analysis_type} analysis required"
                )
        
        return ValidationResult(is_valid=True)
```

#### 3. **Risk Assessment Framework**
```python
class RiskAssessment:
    """Comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation planning"""
    
    def assess_impact_risks(self, impact_analysis: ImpactAnalysis) -> RiskAssessment:
        risks = []
        for impact in impact_analysis.impacts:
            risk_level = self._calculate_risk_level(impact)
            mitigation_strategy = self._generate_mitigation_strategy(impact, risk_level)
            risks.append(Risk(
                impact=impact,
                risk_level=risk_level,
                mitigation_strategy=mitigation_strategy,
                monitoring_requirements=self._define_monitoring(impact),
                rollback_procedures=self._define_rollback(impact)
            ))
        return RiskAssessment(risks=risks)
```

#### 4. **Impact-Driven Task Generation**
```python
def generate_impact_based_tasks(work_item: WorkItem, impact_analysis: ImpactAnalysis) -> List[Task]:
    """Generate tasks based on comprehensive impact analysis"""
    tasks = [Task(type="implementation", name="Core Implementation")]
    
    # Add tasks based on identified impacts
    if impact_analysis.has_database_changes:
        tasks.extend([
            Task(type="database", name="Database Migration"),
            Task(type="testing", name="Data Integrity Testing"),
            Task(type="backup", name="Database Backup")
        ])
    
    if impact_analysis.has_api_changes:
        tasks.extend([
            Task(type="testing", name="API Contract Testing"),
            Task(type="documentation", name="API Documentation Update"),
            Task(type="versioning", name="API Versioning")
        ])
    
    # ... additional impact-based task generation
    return tasks
```

#### 5. **Comprehensive Validation Framework**
```python
class ComprehensiveValidator:
    """Validates all impacts have been properly addressed"""
    
    def validate_impact_mitigation(self, work_item: WorkItem, impact_analysis: ImpactAnalysis) -> ValidationResult:
        validation_results = []
        
        # Validate each impact category
        if impact_analysis.has_code_dependencies:
            validation_results.append(self._validate_code_dependencies(work_item))
        if impact_analysis.has_database_changes:
            validation_results.append(self._validate_database_changes(work_item))
        if impact_analysis.has_api_changes:
            validation_results.append(self._validate_api_changes(work_item))
        # ... additional validation categories
        
        return self._aggregate_validation_results(validation_results)
```
