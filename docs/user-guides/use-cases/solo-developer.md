**User Profile:** Sarah, 28, Full-stack developer building a SaaS startup  
**Project:** Multi-tenant e-commerce platform (Django + React)  
**AI Usage:** Daily with Claude Code, occasional Cursor  
**Project Size:** 50K+ LOC, growing rapidly  
**Timeline:** 6 months from MVP to launch

---

## Stage 1: Discovery & Installation (Day 1)

### The Problem
Sarah has been building her startup for 3 months. She's using Claude Code daily but constantly re-explaining:
- "We're building a multi-tenant e-commerce platform"
- "We use Django 4.2 with PostgreSQL"
- "We decided on JWT for auth, not sessions"
- "The tenant isolation works like this..."

**Pain Point:** 10-15 minutes per session just explaining context.

### Discovery
Sarah sees a tweet: "APM (Agent Project Manager): Never re-explain your project to AI again"

**Research Process:**
1. Visits GitHub: `github.com/agentpm/aipm`
2. Reads README: "Local-first context persistence for AI coding assistants"
3. Watches demo video: 2-minute overview
4. Checks compatibility: "Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Aider"

### Installation
```bash
# Simple installation
pip install agentpm

# Initialize in her project
cd /workspace/saas-startup
apm init "Multi-Tenant E-Commerce Platform"

🤖 APM (Agent Project Manager) initialized for Multi-Tenant E-Commerce Platform
📋 Context system ready
🔧 Hooks installed for Claude Code
✅ Ready to use!
```

### First Setup
```bash
# Quick project setup
apm work-item create "User Authentication System" --type=feature
apm work-item create "Tenant Isolation" --type=feature
apm work-item create "Payment Processing" --type=feature

# Record initial decisions
apm learnings record --type=decision \
  --content="Use JWT tokens for authentication" \
  --rationale="Multi-tenant architecture requires stateless auth"

apm learnings record --type=decision \
  --content="PostgreSQL with row-level security for tenant isolation" \
  --rationale="ACID compliance and built-in RLS support"
```

**Time Investment:** 15 minutes  
**Immediate Value:** None yet (setup phase)

---

## Stage 2: First Session with Context (Day 2)

### The Experience
Sarah starts her morning coding session:

```bash
# She opens Claude Code as usual
claude

# AIPM hook runs automatically
🤖 APM (Agent Project Manager) Session Started
📋 Active Work Item: User Authentication System
🎯 Current Task: Implement JWT middleware

Context loaded:
  Project: Multi-Tenant E-Commerce Platform
  Tech Stack: Django 4.2, React 18, PostgreSQL 15
  Architecture: Multi-tenant with JWT auth
  Previous Decisions: 2 decisions loaded
  Active Files: auth/middleware.py, models/user.py

Ready to continue work!
```

### The Magic Moment
Sarah realizes she doesn't need to explain anything. Claude Code already knows:
- The project structure
- Previous architectural decisions
- Current work item context
- Files she's been working on

**Time Saved:** 12 minutes (no re-explanation needed)

### Work Session
Sarah works for 2 hours implementing JWT middleware. At the end:

```bash
# Session ends, AIPM captures learnings
apm session end

✅ Session ended (2h 15m)
📝 Learnings captured:
  - Decision: Use django-rest-framework-simplejwt for JWT implementation
  - Pattern: JWT middleware should validate tenant_id in token
  - Discovery: DRF SimpleJWT has built-in tenant support
  - Files modified: auth/middleware.py, settings.py

Context updated for next session.
```

**Value Realized:** Context persistence works!

---

## Stage 3: Multi-Provider Workflow (Week 2)

### The Scenario
Sarah needs to switch between Claude Code (architecture) and Cursor (implementation):

```bash
# Morning: Architecture work in Claude Code
claude

🤖 APM (Agent Project Manager) Session Started
📋 Active Work Item: User Authentication System
🎯 Current Task: Design JWT refresh strategy

Context loaded:
  Previous session: JWT middleware implemented
  Decisions: 3 decisions loaded
  Patterns: JWT middleware pattern established

# After 1.5 hours of architecture work
apm session handoff --to=cursor

✅ Handoff prepared for cursor
Summary:
- Duration: 1h 30m
- Decisions: 1 (JWT refresh strategy)
- Files modified: 0 (architecture phase)

Next: Open Cursor and continue work.
```

### Cursor Session
```bash
# Afternoon: Implementation work in Cursor
cursor

🖱️ Cursor session started
🔄 Continuing from claude-code
📋 Previous session: 1h 30m, 1 decision

Context loaded (same context as Claude Code):
  - JWT refresh strategy decision
  - All previous architectural decisions
  - Implementation patterns to follow

# Sarah implements the JWT refresh endpoint
# Cursor knows the context and patterns
```

**Value Realized:** Zero context loss when switching providers!

## Stage 4: Prolonged Usage (Month 2)

### The Evolution
After 2 months of daily usage, Sarah's AIPM database contains:
- 15 work items
- 47 decisions
- 23 patterns
- 12 discoveries
- 8 completed features

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Sarah starts a new session
