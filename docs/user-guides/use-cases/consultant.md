> **Navigation**: [📚 Index](INDEX.md) | [← Previous](use-cases/solo-developer.md) | [Next →](use-cases/enterprise.md)

**User Profile:** David, 35, Independent consultant managing 5 client projects  
**Projects:** Various (React app, Django API, Node.js service, Python data pipeline, Go microservice)  
**AI Usage:** Daily with Claude Code, Cursor, Aider across different projects  
**Project Sizes:** 10K-100K LOC each  
**Timeline:** 6 months of consulting work

---

## Stage 1: Discovery & Multi-Project Setup (Day 1)

### The Problem
David manages 5 different client projects simultaneously. He's constantly dealing with:
- **Context Switching:** "What was I working on for Client A?"
- **Decision Confusion:** "Did I decide on PostgreSQL for Client B or Client C?"
- **Pattern Mixing:** Accidentally using Client A's patterns in Client B's code
- **Time Tracking:** "How much time did I spend on each project?"

**Pain Point:** 20+ minutes per day just switching between project contexts.

### Discovery
David sees a LinkedIn post: "APM (Agent Project Manager): Manage multiple projects without context loss"

**Research Process:**
1. Visits GitHub: `github.com/agentpm/aipm`
2. Reads README: "Local-first context persistence for AI coding assistants"
3. Checks multi-project support: "Works with multiple projects simultaneously"
4. Reviews consultant testimonials: "Saves 2+ hours per day"

### Installation
```bash
# Simple installation
pip install agentpm

# Initialize for consulting work
cd /workspace/consulting
apm init "Consulting Projects"

🤖 APM (Agent Project Manager) initialized for Consulting Projects
📋 Context system ready
🔧 Hooks installed for Claude Code, Cursor, Aider
✅ Ready to use!
```

### Multi-Project Setup
```bash
# Set up each client project
apm project create "Client A - E-commerce Platform" \
  --type=web-app \
  --tech-stack="React, Node.js, PostgreSQL" \
  --client="Client A" \
  --timeline="3 months"

apm project create "Client B - Data Pipeline" \
  --type=data-pipeline \
  --tech-stack="Python, Apache Airflow, BigQuery" \
  --client="Client B" \
  --timeline="2 months"

apm project create "Client C - API Service" \
  --type=api \
  --tech-stack="Django, PostgreSQL, Redis" \
  --client="Client C" \
  --timeline="4 months"

apm project create "Client D - Microservice" \
  --type=microservice \
  --tech-stack="Go, Docker, Kubernetes" \
  --client="Client D" \
  --timeline="1 month"

apm project create "Client E - Mobile App" \
  --type=mobile \
  --tech-stack="React Native, Node.js, MongoDB" \
  --client="Client E" \
  --timeline="6 months"
```

**Time Investment:** 45 minutes  
**Immediate Value:** None yet (setup phase)

## Stage 2: First Multi-Project Session (Day 2)

### The Experience
David starts his morning working on Client A's e-commerce platform:

```bash
# He opens Claude Code as usual
claude

# AIPM hook runs automatically
🤖 APM (Agent Project Manager) Session Started
📋 Active Project: Client A - E-commerce Platform
🎯 Current Task: Implement payment integration

Context loaded:
  Project: Client A - E-commerce Platform
  Tech Stack: React, Node.js, PostgreSQL
  Client: Client A
  Timeline: 3 months (Month 2)
  Previous Decisions: 0 decisions loaded
  Active Files: src/payment/payment.ts, src/api/payment.js
  Time Tracking: 0 hours today

Ready to continue work!
```

### The Magic Moment
David realizes he doesn't need to remember which project he's working on. APM automatically detects the project context and loads the right information.

**Time Saved:** 5 minutes (no project context switching needed)

### Work Session
David works for 2 hours implementing payment integration. At the end:

```bash
# Session ends, AIPM captures learnings
apm session end

✅ Session ended (2h 15m)
📝 Learnings captured:
  - Decision: Use Stripe for payment processing
  - Pattern: Payment webhooks should be idempotent
  - Discovery: Stripe has built-in idempotency
  - Files modified: src/payment/payment.ts, src/api/payment.js
  - Time tracked: 2h 15m for Client A

Context updated for next session.
```

**Value Realized:** Context persistence works for multi-project management!

---

## Stage 3: Project Switching (Day 3)

### The Challenge
David needs to switch to Client B's data pipeline project.

### Project Switch
```bash
# David switches to Client B project
apm project switch "Client B - Data Pipeline"

🔄 Switched to Client B - Data Pipeline
📋 Project: Client B - Data Pipeline
🎯 Current Task: Optimize data processing performance

Context loaded:
  Project: Client B - Data Pipeline
  Tech Stack: Python, Apache Airflow, BigQuery
  Client: Client B
  Timeline: 2 months (Month 1)
  Previous Decisions: 0 decisions loaded
  Active Files: dags/data_processing.py, utils/bigquery_client.py
  Time Tracking: 0 hours today

Ready to continue work!
```

### The Result
David can switch between projects instantly with full context, no confusion about which project he's working on.

**Value Realized:** Seamless project switching with context preservation!

  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    try {
      return await processPayment(paymentData);
    } catch (error) {
      if (i === maxRetries - 1) throw error;
      await delay(Math.pow(2, i) * 1000); // Exponential backoff
    }
  }
}
  " \
  --when-to-use="Any payment processing that needs retry logic"
```

### Cross-Project Application
```bash
# David switches to Client C's API project
apm project switch "Client C - API Service"

🔄 Switched to Client C - API Service
