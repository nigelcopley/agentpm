# Ideas Workflow

> **Navigation**: [üìö Index](INDEX.md) | [‚Üê Previous](workflows/phase-workflow.md) | [Next ‚Üí](workflows/troubleshooting.md)

## Overview

Ideas in APM (Agent Project Manager) provide a lightweight brainstorming system before committing to formal work items. They enable low-friction capture of concepts that can be voted on, refined through research and design, and eventually converted to work items.

## When to Use Ideas vs Work Items

### Use Ideas For:
- **Early brainstorming** - Capturing concepts before they're fully formed
- **Team voting** - Democratic prioritization of concepts
- **Research phase** - Investigating feasibility and requirements
- **Design exploration** - Planning approach before implementation
- **Low-friction capture** - Quick capture without formal structure

### Use Work Items For:
- **Formal deliverables** - Features, bug fixes, research projects
- **Structured workflow** - Following quality gates and phase progression
- **Task management** - Breaking down work into actionable tasks
- **Time tracking** - Effort estimation and time-boxing
- **Dependencies** - Managing relationships between deliverables

## Idea Lifecycle

Ideas follow a simple 6-state lifecycle:

```
idea ‚Üí research ‚Üí design ‚Üí accepted ‚Üí converted (terminal)
any state ‚Üí rejected (terminal)
```

### States Explained

1. **idea** - Initial brainstorming state
2. **research** - Investigating feasibility and requirements
3. **design** - Planning approach and architecture
4. **accepted** - Ready for conversion to work item
5. **converted** - Successfully became a work item (terminal)
6. **rejected** - Not viable, kept for audit trail (terminal)

## Phase Alignment with Work Items

Ideas align with work item phases to ensure smooth transition:

| Idea Status | Work Item Phase | Description |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| idea | pre-D1 | Before discovery phase |
| research | D1_DISCOVERY | Discovery and requirements gathering |
| design | P1_PLAN | Planning and design phase |
| accepted | P1_PLAN | Ready for implementation |
| converted | (work item) | Continues in work item phases |
| rejected | (none) | No work item created |

## Common Workflows

### 1. Quick Idea Capture
```bash
# Create a simple idea
apm idea create "Add dark mode support"

# Add more details
apm idea update 5 --description "Support system dark mode with user preference toggle"
apm idea update 5 --tags ui accessibility
```

### 2. Team Voting and Prioritization
```bash
# List ideas for voting
apm idea list --status=idea

# Vote on ideas
apm idea vote 5 --upvote
apm idea vote 8 --downvote

# See top ideas
apm idea list --limit=10
```

### 3. Research and Design Process
```bash
# Start research phase
apm idea transition 5 research

# Add research findings
apm idea update 5 --description "Research shows 60% of users prefer dark mode. Technical feasibility confirmed."

# Move to design phase
apm idea transition 5 design

# Add design details
apm idea update 5 --description "Design: Toggle in user settings, system preference detection, CSS variables approach"

# Accept the idea
apm idea transition 5 accepted
```

### 4. Conversion to Work Item
```bash
# Convert to work item (auto-phase detection)
apm idea convert 5

# Convert with specific type and priority
apm idea convert 5 --type=feature --priority=2

# Convert and skip discovery phase (research/design already done)
apm idea convert 5 --start-phase=P1_PLAN

# Convert and start directly in implementation
apm idea convert 5 --start-phase=I1_IMPLEMENTATION
```

## CLI Commands Reference

### Core Commands
- `apm idea create "Title"` - Create new idea
- `apm idea list` - List ideas with filters
- `apm idea show <id>` - Display idea details
- `apm idea context <id>` - Show comprehensive context
- `apm idea vote <id> --upvote/--downvote` - Vote on idea
- `apm idea update <id> --description="..."` - Update idea
- `apm idea transition <id> <status>` - Move through workflow
- `apm idea convert <id>` - Convert to work item
- `apm idea reject <id> "Reason"` - Reject idea

### Useful Filters
- `apm idea list --status=accepted` - Ideas ready for conversion
- `apm idea list --tags=ui` - Ideas with specific tags
- `apm idea list --limit=10` - Top 10 ideas by votes

## Best Practices

### 1. Idea Creation
- **Clear titles** - Use descriptive, actionable titles
- **Add tags** - Categorize for easy filtering
- **Include source** - Track where ideas come from
- **Set attribution** - Record who created the idea

### 2. Research Phase
- **Investigate feasibility** - Technical and business viability
- **Gather requirements** - User needs and constraints
- **Assess effort** - Rough estimation of complexity
- **Document findings** - Update description with research results

### 3. Design Phase
- **Plan approach** - Architecture and implementation strategy
- **Consider alternatives** - Evaluate different solutions
- **Define scope** - What's included and excluded
- **Document decisions** - Rationale for chosen approach

### 4. Conversion
- **Choose right type** - Feature, bugfix, research, etc.
- **Set appropriate priority** - Based on business value
- **Use phase override** - Skip phases if work already done
- **Add business context** - Justification and impact

## Integration with Work Items

### Traceability
- Ideas maintain bidirectional links with work items
- Work items show origin information
- Full audit trail from brainstorm to delivery

### Context Transfer
- Idea metadata copied to work item
- Tags, source, and votes preserved
- Research and design work carried forward

### Phase Continuity
- Work items start in appropriate phase
- No duplication of research/design work
- Smooth transition from exploration to execution

## Decision Tree: Idea vs Work Item

```
Is this a fully formed concept with clear requirements?
‚îú‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Create Work Item
‚îî‚îÄ No ‚Üí Is this worth exploring further?
    ‚îú‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Create Idea
    ‚îî‚îÄ No ‚Üí Don't create anything

Is this a quick fix or small improvement?
‚îú‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Create Work Item (type: bugfix/enhancement)
‚îî‚îÄ No ‚Üí Is this a new feature or major change?
    ‚îú‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Create Idea (explore first)
    ‚îî‚îÄ No ‚Üí Create Work Item (type: research/planning)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Can I convert an idea that's not in 'accepted' status?**
A: No, only ideas in 'accepted' status can be converted. Use `apm idea transition <id> accepted` first.

**Q: What happens to idea votes after conversion?**
A: Votes are preserved in work item metadata for historical reference.

**Q: Can I reject an idea that's already converted?**
A: No, converted ideas are in terminal state. Create a new work item to track issues.

**Q: How do I see which work item came from an idea?**
A: Use `apm work-item show <id>` to see origin information, or `apm idea show <id>` to see conversion details.

### Getting Help
- Use `apm idea context <id>` for comprehensive information
- Check `apm idea show <id>` for current status and next steps
- Review phase alignment with `apm idea show <id>` output
