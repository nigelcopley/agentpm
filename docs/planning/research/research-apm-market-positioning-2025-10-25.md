**Characteristics**:
- **Registry**: Google Registry (launched 2015)
- **Primary Association**: Fitness, running, sports communities
- **Availability**: Widely available through registrars (Namecheap, GoDaddy, EuroDNS)
- **Pricing**: $3.48 - varies by registrar
- **Tech Usage**: Limited examples found

**Tech Startup Domain Trends**:
- **.tech** is heavily adopted by tech startups (shadow.tech, brilliant.tech, lightly.tech)
- **.dev** is popular for developer tools
- **.ai** is common for AI companies
- **.run** is **underutilized in tech**, presenting opportunity for differentiation

**apm.run Brand Analysis**:

- ✅ Action-oriented, dynamic connotation ("run" suggests execution)
- ✅ Short, memorable, easy to type
- ✅ Aligns with CLI mental model (`apm run`, command execution)
- ✅ Differentiates from crowded .ai/.dev space
- ✅ Available for registration

**Considerations**:
- ⚠️ Primary .run association is fitness/sports, not tech
- ⚠️ Less established than .dev or .ai for developer tools
- ⚠️ May require additional brand education

**Alternative Domains**:
- **apm.ai**: AI-focused, clear positioning, competitive space
- **apm.dev**: Developer-focused, crowded market
- **getagpm.com**: Traditional alternative
- **agentpm.dev**: More descriptive, longer

## 7. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### 7.1 Brand Confusion Risk

**Risk**: APM acronym confusion with Application Performance Monitoring

**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Always use full name "Agent Project Manager" in marketing materials
2. Clear tagline differentiation: "Multi-Agent Project Management"
3. Domain (apm.run) creates distinct identity
4. Target different audience (developers doing PM, not DevOps/SRE)
5. Educational content explaining the distinction

**Monitoring**:
- Track search result positioning for "APM"
- Monitor brand mention sentiment
- Survey user awareness in beta testing

---

### 7.2 .run Domain Perception Risk

**Risk**: .run domain primarily associated with fitness/sports, not tech

**Likelihood**: Low
**Impact**: Low

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Strong brand identity beyond domain
2. Action-oriented messaging ("run your projects")
3. CLI metaphor reinforcement (`apm run`)
4. Alternative domains as redirects (apm.ai, apm.dev)

**Monitoring**:
- User feedback on domain perception
- Bounce rate from domain landing
- Brand recall testing

---

### 7.3 Market Education Risk

**Risk**: Multi-agent orchestration concept unfamiliar to developers

**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Simple, relatable metaphors ("your AI PM team")
2. Progressive disclosure of complexity
3. Show, don't tell: demos and videos
4. Compare to familiar concepts (Git workflow, CI/CD pipelines)
5. Free tier for hands-on learning

**Monitoring**:
- Time to first value metrics
- Feature adoption rates
- Support ticket topics
- Onboarding drop-off points

---

### 7.4 Competitive Response Risk

**Risk**: Established players (Linear, Jira) add CLI or multi-agent features

**Likelihood**: Medium (12-18 months)
**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Speed to market**: Launch MVP quickly
2. **Community moat**: Build open source community
3. **Deep differentiation**: Database-first architecture hard to replicate
4. **Continuous innovation**: Rapid agent development cycle
5. **Developer relationships**: Build loyal user base early

**Competitive Advantages**:
