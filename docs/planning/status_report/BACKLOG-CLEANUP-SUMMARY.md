**Duplicate (2)**: WI-127 (merge into WI-128)

```bash
# Execute cleanup script
bash /path/to/cleanup-script.sh

### 2. ACTIVATE (3 items) - Decision Required

**Launch-Critical Items** (20.5 hours total):

| ID | Name | Hours | Rationale |
|----|------|-------|-----------|
| **WI-143** | Preflight E2E Testing - Complete Route & Command Validation | 8.0h | Option B Days 5-6 comprehensive QA |
| **WI-144** | Live Project E2E Testing - Production Validation | 4.0h | Real-world usage validation |
| **WI-142** | Extract AIPM as orcx - Public Repository & Branding | 8.5h | Required for public v1.0 release |

**Decision Point**: Do these warrant inclusion in Option B launch timeline?

## Recommendations

### For Stakeholders

**Immediate (Today)**:
1. Approve Phase 1 cleanup (21 items closed)
2. Review WI-142/143/144 for launch inclusion
3. Confirm v1.1 roadmap priorities

**This Week**:
- Execute approved cleanup
- Activate approved launch items
- Update launch timeline if needed

**Post-Launch**:
- Begin v1.1 Priority 1 items
- Adjust based on user feedback
- Archive v1.2+ items appropriately

---

### For Development Team

**Phase 1 (30 min)**: Execute cleanup script
**Phase 2 (2h)**: Create tasks for activated items
**Phase 3 (20.5h)**: Execute launch-critical work (if approved)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Increased Launch Scope (+20.5h)
**Mitigation**: Items are testing/branding, not core functionality
**Contingency**: Defer WI-142 if timeline pressure

### Risk: v1.1 Commitment (208h deferred)
**Mitigation**: Clear prioritization, user feedback-driven
**Contingency**: Further defer lower-priority items

### Risk: Lost Work from Closures
**Mitigation**: All closures are test items or duplicates
**Contingency**: Items remain in database, can resurrect if needed
