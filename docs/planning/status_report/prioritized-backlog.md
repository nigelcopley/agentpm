## Work Item Categorization

### CRITICAL FOR LAUNCH (Must Complete) - 6 items, 4.5h

These work items are essentially complete but need formal closure:

| ID | Name | Type | Status | Effort | Action |
|----|------|------|--------|--------|--------|
| 125 | Core System Readiness Review | analysis | active | 0.5h | Finalize report and close |
| 126 | Integration Points Analysis | analysis | active | 0.5h | Finalize report and close |
| 137 | Full audit of core/cli implementation | analysis | active | 0.5h | Finalize report and close |
| 35 | Professional Session Management System | feature | active | 2.0h | Complete 2 review tasks |
| 114 | Claude Persistent Memory System | feature | active | 0.5h | Finalize and close |
| 138 | Search Module - Add SUMMARIES/EVIDENCE | enhancement | ready | 0.5h | Mark as done |

**Total Effort**: 4.5 hours
**Blocking**: Launch readiness
**Risk**: LOW (mostly administrative closure)

---

### HIGH PRIORITY (Should Complete for v1.0) - 1 item, 8h

| ID | Name | Type | Status | Effort | Impact | Recommendation |
|----|------|------|--------|--------|--------|----------------|
| 140 | Refactor Web Routes for Better Organization | refactoring | active | 8.0h | Code maintainability, route clarity | COMPLETE for v1.0 |

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates route overlap between blueprints
- Consistent RESTful naming patterns
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved developer experience
- Professional code organization

**Current Progress**: 2/5 tasks complete, 1 in progress
**Risk**: LOW (refactoring, not new features)
**Can Launch Without**: YES (but recommended to include)

---

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice to Have for v1.0) - 3 items, 48h

| ID | Name | Type | Status | Effort | Defer Rationale |
|----|------|------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 134 | Integrate FTS5 Search into Web Frontend | feature | active | 16h | Backend search works via CLI, web UI is enhancement |
| 119 | Claude Integration Consolidation | feature | active | 20h | Core agents functional, consolidation is optimization |
| 132 | Implement FTS5 Full-Text Search System | feature | active | 12h | Backend complete (WI-138), web UI is WI-134 |

**Recommendation**: **DEFER ALL TO v1.1**

**Justification**:
1. **WI-134**: Search works via CLI (`apm search`), web UI is nice-to-have
2. **WI-119**: Agents operational, consolidation improves architecture but not blocking
3. **WI-132**: Backend complete, frontend integration captured in WI-134

**Impact of Deferral**: Minimal - core functionality operational

---

### LOW PRIORITY (Defer to v1.1+) - 2 items, 12h+

| ID | Name | Type | Status | Effort | Defer Rationale |
|----|------|------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 116 | Claude Code Comprehensive Integration | feature | active | 12h | Core functionality exists, additional features not critical |
| 106 | Test Next Command Workflow | enhancement | ready | TBD | Part of broader testing improvement plan |

**Recommendation**: **DEFER TO v1.1+**

**Justification**:
1. **WI-116**: 12/16 tasks complete, core integration operational
2. **WI-106**: Testing workflow validation, part of v1.1 testing improvements

---

### TECHNICAL DEBT (Post-Launch) - Ongoing

| Category | Items | Effort | Priority |
|----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Code Quality | 58 TODO/FIXME markers | 20h | v1.1 |
| Adapter Migration | 62% remaining (38% complete) | 40h | v1.1-v1.2 |
| Testing Coverage | Increase from ~40% to >80% | 60h | v1.1 HIGH |
| CI/CD Pipeline | Automated testing and deployment | 16h | v1.1 HIGH |
| Documentation | User guides for advanced features | 12h | v1.1 |
| Performance | Optimize query performance | 8h | v1.2 |

**Total Technical Debt**: ~156 hours
**Approach**: Incremental improvement across v1.1-v1.2 releases
