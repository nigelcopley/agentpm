## Risk Analysis

### Critical Risks

#### 1. Testing Coverage Gap (HIGH IMPACT)
- **Issue**: Testing system rated 2.5/5.0
- **Impact**: Quality assurance, production stability
- **Gaps**:
  - Low test coverage (<50% estimated)
  - Missing integration tests
  - No CI/CD pipeline
  - Manual testing required
- **Mitigation**:
  - Create comprehensive test plan (v1.1)
  - Implement CI/CD (v1.1)
  - Manual testing protocol for v1.0 launch
  - Document known issues

#### 2. Active Implementation Tasks (MEDIUM IMPACT)
- **Issue**: 2 tasks in progress, 3 in review
- **Impact**: Potential incomplete features
- **Mitigation**:
  - Complete review tasks for WI-35 (2h)
  - Complete or defer WI-140 task (8h or defer)
  - Complete or defer WI-119 task (defer recommended)

#### 3. Technical Debt Accumulation (LOW IMPACT)
- **Issue**: 58 TODO/FIXME markers in codebase
- **Impact**: Long-term maintainability
- **Mitigation**:
