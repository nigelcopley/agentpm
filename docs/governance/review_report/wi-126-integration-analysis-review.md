**Evidence:** Integrated into web interface and CLI system assessments

### Cancelled Composite Tasks (6)

These tasks were **intentionally cancelled** as composite tasks, replaced by more granular analysis tasks:

1. **Task #657:** Provider Adapter Integration Analysis → Replaced by tasks #686-689
2. **Task #658:** Hooks System Integration Review → Replaced by tasks #690-692
3. **Task #659:** Web Interface Integration Assessment → Replaced by tasks #693-694
4. **Task #660:** CLI Command Integration Analysis → Replaced by tasks #695-696, #698-699
5. **Task #697:** External Tool Integrations → Covered by CLI analysis
6. **Task #700:** API and SDK integrations → Replaced by tasks #701-702

**Rationale:** Decomposition into atomic analysis tasks improved clarity and traceability.
