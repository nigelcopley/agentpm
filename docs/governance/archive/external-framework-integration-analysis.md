## Part 3: Detailed Integration Recommendations

### 3.1 Phase 1: Constitution-Based Governance (Months 1-2)

#### **What to Implement**
- Constitution framework with versioned project principles
- Amendment workflows with approval processes
- Consistency validation between constitution and enforcement code
- Human-readable governance documents with semantic versioning

#### **Why This Priority**
- **Foundation First**: Governance is the foundation for all other capabilities
- **Immediate Value**: Replaces hardcoded rules with configurable, auditable governance
- **Low Risk**: Builds on existing rules infrastructure without major architectural changes
- **Stakeholder Buy-in**: Provides human-readable governance that non-technical stakeholders can understand

#### **How to Implement**

**Database Schema Extensions:**
```sql
-- Extend existing rules table
ALTER TABLE rules ADD COLUMN version TEXT DEFAULT '1.0.0';
ALTER TABLE rules ADD COLUMN ratified_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE rules ADD COLUMN ratified_by TEXT;
ALTER TABLE rules ADD COLUMN amendment_notes TEXT;
ALTER TABLE rules ADD COLUMN supersedes_rule_id INTEGER;

-- New constitution management table
CREATE TABLE project_constitutions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    version TEXT NOT NULL,
    constitution_markdown TEXT NOT NULL,
    ratified_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    ratified_by TEXT,
    amendment_summary TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id),
    UNIQUE(project_id, version)
);

-- Rule history for audit trail
CREATE TABLE rule_history (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    rule_id INTEGER,
    version TEXT,
    changed_at TIMESTAMP,
    changed_by TEXT,
    change_summary TEXT,
    old_config TEXT,
    new_config TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (rule_id) REFERENCES rules(id)
);
```

**Implementation Components:**
1. **Constitution Parser**: Markdown → database rule generation
2. **Amendment Workflow**: Proposal → review → ratification → deployment
3. **Consistency Validator**: Constitution vs. enforcement code validation
4. **Version Management**: Semantic versioning with rollback capabilities

**CLI Commands:**
```bash
apm constitution create "Project governance principles"
apm constitution amend --proposal "Increase IMPLEMENTATION time-box to 6h"
apm constitution ratify --version 2.0.0 --notes "Approved by team vote"
apm constitution validate --check-consistency
apm constitution history --show-changes
