# Implementation Priorities & Roadmap

**Analysis Date**: 2025-10-16
**Based On**: Complete system review + documentation analysis
**Purpose**: Prioritized action plan for next 3 months

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Strategic Overview**

### **Current State**
- **System Maturity**: 85-90% (production-ready core)
- **Documentation Accuracy**: 75% (good but outdated)
- **Feature Completeness**: 35% of ADR scope (selective implementation)
- **Critical Issues**: 10 identified (6h to fix critical, 22.5h for all)

### **Key Realization**

**The system is MORE COMPLETE than documentation suggests**

Many features documented as "Not Started" or "Future" are actually 50-90% implemented. The gap is:
1. **Documentation doesn't reflect code reality** (6-12 months outdated)
2. **High-value features designed but unimplemented** (sub-agents, reporting, review workflows)
3. **Integration work needed** (phase gates designed but not wired to workflow)
