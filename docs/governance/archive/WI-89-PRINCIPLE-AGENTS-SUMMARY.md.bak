# WI-89: Implement Principle-Based Agents System - Summary

**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS ✅
**Priority**: 1 (Critical)
**Effort**: 26.5 hours across 6 tasks

---

## 📋 Overview

### What We're Building
A **principle-based code quality agent system** that:
- Automates SOLID, DRY, KISS, and other software engineering principles
- Provides **framework-specific** recommendations (Django, React, Flask, etc.)
- Integrates seamlessly with **existing R1 quality gate**
- Delivers **educational feedback** to developers
- Enables **measurable quality metrics** tracking over time

### Why It Matters
- ✅ **Reduces technical debt** through automated principle enforcement
- ✅ **Accelerates learning** with educational, contextual feedback
- ✅ **Improves code quality** with framework-aware recommendations
- ✅ **Enables metrics** to track quality improvement trends
- ✅ **Zero breaking changes** - Enhances existing system only

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Integration

### Current AIPM (What You Already Have)
```
Master Orchestrator (delegate-only)
    ↓
Mini-Orchestrators (6 phases)
    ├─ DefinitionOrch → D1 gate
    ├─ PlanningOrch → P1 gate
    ├─ ImplementationOrch → I1 gate
    ├─ ReviewTestOrch → R1 gate ⭐ INTEGRATION POINT
    ├─ ReleaseOpsOrch → O1 gate
    └─ EvolutionOrch → E1 gate
        ↓
    Sub-Agents (25 existing)
        ├─ static-analyzer
        ├─ test-runner
        ├─ threat-screener
        ├─ ac-verifier
        └─ quality-gatekeeper ⭐ AGGREGATOR
```

### Enhanced AIPM (With Principle Agents)
```
ReviewTestOrch
    ↓
Existing Sub-Agents          +  Principle Agents ⭐ NEW
├─ static-analyzer           ├─ solid-agent
├─ test-runner               ├─ dry-agent
├─ threat-screener           ├─ kiss-agent
├─ ac-verifier               └─ (12 more for MVP)
└─ quality-gatekeeper
        ↓
    Aggregates ALL results (existing + principle)
        ↓
    Enhanced R1 Gate Report with Principle Scores
```

### Key Integration Strategy
✅ **Reuses Everything**:
- Existing 260-rule database
- Existing plugin system (tech stack detection)
- Existing quality-gatekeeper (just enhance aggregation)
- Existing ReviewTestOrch flow

✅ **Adds Only**:
- New directory: `agentpm/agents/` (~2000 LOC)
- New principle agent classes (15 agents for MVP)
- Framework adapters (Django, Python, React, Flask)
- Enhanced quality-gatekeeper (~50 LOC changes)

✅ **Breaks Nothing**:
- Zero changes to existing orchestrators
- Zero changes to database schema
- Zero changes to CLI commands (optional `apm principle-check` can be added)
- Backward compatible - works with/without rules enabled

## 🔧 Technical Approach

### Three-Layer Architecture

**Layer 1: Universal Principle Agent** (Framework-Agnostic)
```python
class SOLIDAgent(PrincipleAgent):
    """Universal SOLID principles - works for any language/framework"""

    def analyze(self, code_path: str, tech_stack: TechStack) -> AgentReport:
        adapter = self._get_adapter(tech_stack)  # Django, React, Flask, etc.
        violations = adapter.check_all_principles(code_path)
        return self._generate_report(violations)
```

**Layer 2: Framework Adapter** (Tech-Specific)
```python
class DjangoSOLIDAdapter(SOLIDAdapter):
    """Adapts SOLID checks for Django framework"""

    def check_srp(self, code_path: str) -> List[Violation]:
        # Django-specific: Fat models, views with business logic
        violations = []
        for model in self._find_models(code_path):
            if self._has_business_logic(model):
                violations.append(Violation(
                    principle="SRP",
                    location=f"{model.file}:{model.line}",
                    issue=f"Model {model.name} contains business logic",
                    recommendation="Extract to service layer (Django pattern)"
                ))
        return violations
```

**Layer 3: Pattern Checker** (Framework Patterns)
```python
class DjangoPatternChecker:
    """Detects Django-specific patterns"""

    PATTERNS = {
        'fat_models': {
            'detection': lambda model: len(model.methods) > 10,
            'recommendation': 'Extract to service layer'
        },
        'n_plus_one': {
            'detection': has_related_access_in_loop,
            'recommendation': 'Use select_related() or prefetch_related()'
        }
    }
```

## 📈 Impact Analysis

### What Changes
✅ **New**: `agentpm/agents/` directory (~2000 LOC)
✅ **Enhanced**: `quality-gatekeeper` aggregation (~50 LOC)
✅ **Optional**: `apm principle-check` CLI command

### What Stays the Same
✅ Master Orchestrator (unchanged)
✅ 6 Mini-Orchestrators (ReviewTestOrch gets principle agents)
✅ Database schema (unchanged)
✅ Rules system (reuse existing 260 rules)
✅ Plugin system (reuse tech detection)
✅ All existing tests (unchanged)

### Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Integration bugs | Medium | Comprehensive test suite |
| Performance | Medium | Parallel execution, <2s target |
| False positives | Low | Framework adapters |
| Team adoption | Medium | Progressive rollout, optional |

**Overall**: ✅ **LOW RISK** - Additive, well-tested integration

## 🎓 Educational Benefits

### Before (Generic Linter)
```
❌ Line too long (80 characters)
```

### After (Principle Agent)
```
⚠️ SOLID Violation: Single Responsibility Principle

Location: models/order.py:45
Issue: Order model contains business logic, email sending, and payment processing

Why This Matters:
  Single Responsibility Principle states each class should have
  ONE reason to change. Multiple responsibilities make the class
  harder to test, maintain, and understand.

Django Context:
  Django follows "skinny models, fat services" pattern.
  Models should only define data structure.

Recommendation:
  Extract responsibilities to appropriate Django components:
  ✅ Keep in Model: Field definitions, simple properties
  ❌ Extract to OrderService: calculate_total()
  ❌ Extract to NotificationService: send_confirmation_email()
  ❌ Extract to PaymentService: charge_payment()

Example (Before):
  class Order(models.Model):
      def calculate_total(self): ...  # Business logic
      def send_confirmation(self): ...  # External API
      def charge_payment(self): ...  # External API

Example (After):
  class Order(models.Model):
      total = models.DecimalField()  # Data only

  class OrderService:
      def create_order(self, items):  # Business logic
          order = Order.objects.create(...)
          NotificationService.send_confirmation(order)
          PaymentService.charge(order)
          return order

```

**Impact**: Developer **learns** the principle, not just "fixes a warning"

- **What**: Specific violation found
- **Why**: Principle violated and importance
- **How**: Concrete refactoring steps
- **Example**: Before/after code
- **Reference**: Links to detailed docs

### 3. Progressive Quality (Kent Beck)
```
Phase 1: make-it-work-agent → Functionality first
    ↓
Phase 2: make-it-right-agent → SOLID/DRY/KISS refactoring
    ↓
Phase 3: make-it-fast-agent → Performance optimization
```

### 4. Measurable Improvement
Track principle adherence over time:
- SOLID score: 78% → 85% → 92% (improving)
- DRY violations: 12 → 6 → 2 (reducing)
- Team learning curve visible

Status: PASS
```

**After (With Principle Agents)**:
```
R1 Gate Results:
✅ Tests: 94% coverage
✅ Static analysis: Clean
✅ Security: No vulnerabilities
✅ Acceptance criteria: Met

⭐ Principle Analysis (NEW):
⚠️ SOLID: 78% (3 violations)
  1. models/order.py:45: Fat model detected
     → Extract business logic to OrderService (Django pattern)
     Learn: https://docs.agentpm.dev/principles/solid/srp

  2. views/checkout.py:23: View has multiple responsibilities
     → Delegate to forms and services (Django MTV pattern)

  3. services/payment.py:12: Depends on concrete Stripe class
     → Depend on PaymentInterface abstraction (DIP)

✅ DRY: 92% (1 duplication)
  1. Validation duplicated in login/register
     → Extract to shared validators.validate_user_input()

⚠️ KISS: 75% (2 complexity issues)
  1. calculate_total(): Complexity 15 (max 10)
     → Extract sub-methods for readability
  2. Nesting depth 4 levels (max 3)
     → Use early returns (guard clauses)

Overall Principle Score: 82% ⭐

Status: PASS with recommendations

💡 Educational Resources:
   - SOLID Principles: docs/principles/solid.md
