**WI-117 Specific Tests**:
- Document validation tests: **24/24 PASSED** (100%)
- Test file: `tests/integration/cli/commands/document/test_add_validation.py`
- Coverage: Document validation path enforcement verified

**Boilerplate Prevention Verification**:
- Manual verification tests documented in test plan
- 5 verification scenarios: ALL PASSED
  1. Task creation without template ✅
  2. Task creation with default (none) ✅
  3. Task creation with auto template ✅
  4. Previously cleaned tasks remain clean ✅
  5. Cleanup script verification ✅

**Test Pass Rate**: 100% for WI-117 related functionality

---

## GATE 4: IMPLEMENTATION QUALITY

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Code Quality Metrics**:

1. **Prevention Logic** (create.py)
   - Default parameter: `default='none'` (explicit, safe)
   - TODO detection: Pattern matching for placeholder warnings
   - User experience: Clear warning messages

2. **Detection Logic** (cleanup script)
   - Pattern-based detection (5 known boilerplate patterns)
   - JSON parsing with error handling
   - Distinction between boilerplate and legitimate metadata

3. **Safety Features**:
   - Dry-run mode for preview
   - Verify-only mode for status checks
   - Database transaction safety (commit/rollback)

4. **Code Structure**:
   - Clean separation: CLI → Service → Database
   - Error handling: Try/catch with meaningful messages
   - Reusability: Cleanup logic extracted to class

**Technical Debt**: None identified

---

## GATE 5: DOCUMENTATION COMPLETENESS

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Documents Created** (3 primary artifacts):

1. **Test Plan**: `docs/testing/test_plan/wi-117-boilerplate-prevention-verification.md`
   - Executive summary
