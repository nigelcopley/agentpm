# Claude Code & Skills Integration Analysis

**Research Date**: 2025-10-17
**Purpose**: Comprehensive analysis of Claude Code capabilities and AIPM integration strategy
**Status**: Complete

---

## Executive Summary

This research reveals that Claude Code has a sophisticated three-layer architecture (Sub-agents, Skills, Plugins) with native Task tool delegation, memory management, and session persistence. AIPM's current three-tier orchestrator model diverges from Claude Code patterns and should be simplified to align with official architecture.

**Critical Findings**:
1. **Skills are NEW** (launched Oct 16, 2025) - model-invoked capabilities stored as SKILL.md files
2. **Task tool** is the official delegation mechanism (not custom orchestration)
3. **Memory system** uses hierarchical CLAUDE.md files (not database queries)
4. **Agent SDK** enables programmatic agent systems for standalone applications
5. **Hooks system** provides event-driven integration (matches AIPM's needs exactly)

**Recommendation**: Simplify AIPM to use native Task tool, convert workflows to Skills, align agent format with Claude Code standards, and leverage hooks for workflow integration.

## 1. Claude Code Feature Matrix

### Core Architecture Layers

| Layer | Purpose | File Location | Invocation | Context |
|-------|---------|---------------|------------|---------|
| **Sub-agents** | Specialized AI personas for complex tasks | `.claude/agents/` | Task tool or natural language | Isolated context window |
| **Skills** | Procedures/knowledge Claude can use autonomously | `.claude/skills/` | Model-invoked (automatic) | Shared with main agent |
| **Commands** | User-triggered shortcuts | `.claude/commands/` | User `/command` | Main agent context |
| **Plugins** | Distribution packages | Marketplace | Installation | N/A (container) |
| **Hooks** | Event-driven automation | `settings.json` | Event triggers | Same as triggering agent |

### Feature Capabilities

#### Sub-Agents
- **Purpose**: Complex multi-step tasks requiring specialized expertise
- **Context**: Isolated context window (doesn't pollute main conversation)
- **Tool Access**: Configurable (all tools or restricted list)
- **Invocation**:
  - Automatic: Claude selects based on description matching
  - Explicit: "Use the [agent-name] to [task]"
  - Task tool: `Task(subagent_type="agent-name", description="...", prompt="...")`
- **Model Selection**: Can specify sonnet/opus/haiku or inherit from main
- **Delegation Limit**: Sub-agents cannot spawn more sub-agents (one level only)
- **Best For**: Code review, security audits, refactoring, research, analysis

#### Skills (NEW - Oct 2025)
- **Purpose**: Reusable procedures/knowledge Claude invokes autonomously
- **Context**: Loads progressively into main agent context
- **Invocation**: Model-invoked (Claude decides based on description)
- **Components**: SKILL.md + optional supporting files + scripts
- **Composability**: Multiple Skills can work together automatically
- **Portability**: Same format across Claude apps, Claude Code, and API
- **Tool Access**: Can restrict via `allowed-tools` in frontmatter
- **Best For**: Workflows, domain expertise, standard procedures, checklists

#### Commands
- **Purpose**: User-triggered shortcuts for repetitive tasks
- **Context**: Runs in main agent context
- **Invocation**: User types `/command-name`
- **Interactivity**: Supports user input and confirmation
- **Best For**: Init workflows, setup tasks, interactive operations

#### Plugins
- **Purpose**: Package and distribute reusable components
- **Components**: Can include agents, skills, commands, hooks, MCP servers
- **Distribution**: Via marketplaces (anthropics/skills, custom)
- **Installation**: Global (`~/.claude/`) or project-specific (`.claude/`)
- **Best For**: Team-wide standards, reusable workflows, tool integration

#### Hooks
- **Purpose**: Event-driven automation and workflow control
- **Events**: PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, Stop, SubagentStop, PreCompact, SessionStart, SessionEnd
- **Implementation**: Command scripts (bash/python) or inline JSON
- **Control**: Can allow/deny/ask (PreToolUse), block (PostToolUse)
- **I/O**: Receives JSON via stdin, returns via stdout/stderr
- **Best For**: Validation gates, logging, metrics, policy enforcement

### Memory & Session Management

#### Memory System
- **CLAUDE.md**: Project/team memory (version controlled)
- **CLAUDE.local.md**: Personal/machine memory (gitignored)
- **Hierarchy**: Recursive loading from current dir → parent dirs → home
- **Precedence**: More specific (closer to working dir) overrides general
- **Purpose**: Persistent context across sessions (preferences, guidelines, patterns)

#### Session Persistence
- **Continue**: `claude -c` or `--continue` (most recent session)
- **Resume**: `claude -r "session-id"` (specific session)
- **State**: Complete dev environment (processes, file contexts, permissions)
- **Retention**: 30 days default (configurable)

#### Checkpointing
- **Automatic**: Every user prompt creates checkpoint
- **Rewind**: `/rewind` or `Esc` twice
- **Granularity**: Restore conversation XOR code OR both
- **Limitations**: Doesn't track bash changes or external edits
- **Purpose**: Quick undo for exploration/iteration

## 2. Sub-Agent Implementation Guide

### File Format Specification

```markdown
---
name: agent-identifier
description: "When Claude should use this agent - be specific!"
tools: Read, Write, Bash, Grep  # Optional - omit for all tools
model: sonnet  # Optional - sonnet, opus, haiku, or inherit
---

# Agent System Prompt

## Role
You are a specialized [role] agent focused on [domain].

## Capabilities
- Capability 1
- Capability 2

## Approach
1. Step 1
2. Step 2

## Constraints
- Constraint 1
- Constraint 2

## Output Format
Describe expected output format.
```

### Critical Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Format | Purpose |
|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| `name` | YES | `kebab-case` | Agent identifier for invocation |
| `description` | YES | Natural language | Determines automatic selection - BE SPECIFIC |
| `tools` | NO | Comma-separated | Tool access (omit = all tools) |
| `model` | NO | `sonnet|opus|haiku` | Model selection (default = inherit) |

### Description Writing Rules

**❌ Vague** (won't trigger reliably):
```yaml
description: "Helps with code"
```

**✅ Specific** (triggers appropriately):
```yaml
description: "Reviews Python code for PEP 8 compliance, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues. Use when analyzing Python files for quality gates or before merging PRs."
```

**Best Practices**:
- Include **trigger conditions** ("Use when...", "For tasks involving...")
- Specify **domain/scope** (languages, frameworks, file types)
- List **key capabilities** explicitly
- Add **proactive hint** if desired: "use PROACTIVELY" in description

### Task Tool Invocation

#### Parameters

```
Task(
  subagent_type="agent-name",      # REQUIRED: Which agent to invoke
  description="Task for UI label",  # REQUIRED: User-facing description
  prompt="Full prompt to agent"     # REQUIRED: What agent receives as user message
)
```

#### How It Works

1. **Parent agent** calls Task tool with prompt
2. **New Claude Code instance** spawns with isolated context
3. **Sub-agent receives** prompt as regular user message (doesn't know it's a sub-agent)
4. **Sub-agent executes** with its system prompt + configured tools
5. **Results return** to parent (compact summary, not full context)
6. **Context isolation** preserves main agent context window

#### Invocation Patterns

**Natural Language (Automatic)**:
```
> Use the security-auditor to check for vulnerabilities in auth.py
> Have the code-reviewer analyze my recent changes
```

**Natural Language (Explicit Orchestration)**:
```
> First use the code-analyzer to identify performance bottlenecks,
> then use the optimizer to fix them, and finally use the test-generator
> to create performance regression tests.
```

**Parallel Delegation** (7-parallel-Task pattern):
```
> For this feature, create 7 parallel tasks:
> 1. Component structure (frontend-architect)
> 2. Styles and CSS (design-system-expert)
> 3. Unit tests (testing-specialist)
> 4. Type definitions (typescript-expert)
> 5. Hooks and utilities (react-patterns-expert)
> 6. Integration (routing, imports)
> 7. Remaining updates (docs, config, package.json)
```

**Multi-Persona Analysis**:
```
> Spawn 4 sub-agents with different perspectives:
> 1. accessibility-expert: Focus on ARIA, keyboard nav, screen readers
> 2. mobile-ux-expert: Focus on responsive design, touch targets
> 3. performance-expert: Focus on bundle size, rendering efficiency
> 4. security-expert: Focus on XSS, CSRF, input validation
> Compare their findings and synthesize recommendations.
```

### Best Practices

**When to Use Sub-Agents**:
- ✅ Complex multi-step tasks (code review, refactoring, analysis)
- ✅ Preserving main context (large codebase searches)
- ✅ Specialized expertise (security audits, performance optimization)
- ✅ Parallel execution (multiple independent analyses)
- ✅ Delegatable work (doesn't require frequent user input)

**When NOT to Use Sub-Agents**:
- ❌ Simple questions (use main agent)
- ❌ Interactive debugging (requires rapid feedback loops)
- ❌ Trivial changes (single-line edits)
- ❌ Tasks requiring main conversation context

**Tool Access Strategy**:
- **Omit `tools` field**: Grant full access (safest default)
- **Restrict tools**: Only for specialized agents with clear scope
- **Example restricted**: `tools: Read, Grep` (read-only analysis agent)

## 3. Skills vs Sub-Agents vs Commands Comparison

### Decision Matrix

| Feature | Skills | Sub-Agents | Commands |
|---------|--------|------------|----------|
| **Invocation** | Model (automatic) | Task tool or explicit | User (manual) |
| **Context** | Main agent (progressive loading) | Isolated window | Main agent |
| **Complexity** | Simple → Medium | Medium → Complex | Simple |
| **Autonomy** | High (Claude decides) | Medium (parent directs) | Low (user directs) |
| **Composability** | High (stack together) | Medium (sequential/parallel) | Low (single-shot) |
| **Learning** | Yes (adds knowledge) | No (executes tasks) | No (runs scripts) |
| **Best For** | Procedures, workflows, domain knowledge | Multi-step tasks, specialized analysis | Repetitive shortcuts, interactive flows |

### Use Case Examples

#### Skills Use Cases
- ✅ "Analyze Excel files and generate pivot tables" (domain procedure)
- ✅ "Convert Figma designs to React components" (workflow)
- ✅ "Validate PR descriptions against team template" (checklist)
- ✅ "Apply company coding standards to Python files" (rules enforcement)
- ✅ "Extract data from PDFs and structure as JSON" (data processing)

#### Sub-Agent Use Cases
- ✅ "Review this 50-file PR for security vulnerabilities" (complex analysis)
- ✅ "Refactor authentication system to use OAuth2" (multi-step implementation)
- ✅ "Investigate memory leak in production logs" (deep debugging)
- ✅ "Generate comprehensive test suite for payment module" (specialized creation)
- ✅ "Analyze competitor websites for UX patterns" (research)

#### Command Use Cases
- ✅ "Initialize new microservice with team template" (interactive setup)
- ✅ "Run deployment checklist and confirm each step" (user-guided workflow)
- ✅ "Generate boilerplate for new API endpoint" (repetitive task)
- ✅ "Create JIRA ticket from current conversation" (integration)
- ✅ "Format all changed files and run linters" (batch operation)

### When to Combine

**Skill + Sub-Agent**: Skill provides procedure, sub-agent executes complex implementation
```
Skill: "PR Review Checklist" (defines steps)
→ Sub-agent: "security-auditor" (performs deep security analysis)
```

**Command + Sub-Agent**: User triggers command, which delegates to specialized agents
```
Command: /deploy-feature
→ Sub-agent 1: "test-runner" (validates tests)
→ Sub-agent 2: "deploy-orchestrator" (executes deployment)
```

**Skill + Command**: Skill defines domain knowledge, command provides interactive UI
```
Skill: "Database Migration Procedures"
Command: /migrate (interactive confirmation at each step)
```

## 4. AIPM Current State Analysis

### Current Architecture

```
Master Orchestrator (CLAUDE.md)
├── Mini-Orchestrators (6 phase-specific)
│   ├── DefinitionOrch (D1 gate)
│   ├── PlanningOrch (P1 gate)
│   ├── ImplementationOrch (I1 gate)
│   ├── ReviewTestOrch (R1 gate)
│   ├── ReleaseOpsOrch (O1 gate)
│   └── EvolutionOrch (E1 gate)
└── Sub-Agents (~25 single-responsibility)
    ├── Utility: workitem-writer, evidence-writer, audit-logger
    ├── Validation: gate-check agents, rule-validator
    ├── Context: context-delivery, context-assembler
    └── Implementation: code-implementer, test-runner, etc.
```

### Current Delegation Mechanism

**Custom System** (not using Task tool):
```python
def master_orchestrate(incoming_artifact):
    orch = route_by_artifact_type(incoming_artifact.type)
    result = delegate_to_mini_orch(orch, incoming_artifact)
    # Custom delegation logic
```

### Current Agent File Format

**AIPM agents** use Markdown with mixed conventions:
- Some have YAML frontmatter, some don't
- Inconsistent metadata (some have description, some don't)
- Not aligned with Claude Code standards
- No `tools` field for tool restrictions
- No `model` field for model selection

### Current Strengths

1. ✅ **Agent directory structure** (`.claude/agents/`) matches Claude Code
2. ✅ **Hooks implementation** exists (session-start, task-start, etc.)
3. ✅ **Event-driven architecture** aligns with Claude Code patterns
4. ✅ **Database-driven workflow** provides audit trail and state management
5. ✅ **Rules system** (`_RULES/`) enables governance

### Current Gaps

1. ❌ **Not using Task tool** - custom delegation breaks Claude Code integration
2. ❌ **Three-tier orchestration** - adds complexity not in Claude Code patterns
3. ❌ **No Skills implementation** - missing newest Claude Code feature
4. ❌ **No plugin structure** - can't distribute via marketplaces
5. ❌ **Agent format misalignment** - frontmatter doesn't match Claude Code spec
6. ❌ **Memory system ignored** - using database instead of CLAUDE.md hierarchy
7. ❌ **Session management divergence** - custom save/load vs. Claude Code persistence

## 5. Alignment Recommendations

### Priority 1: Critical Alignments (Do First)

#### R1.1: Adopt Task Tool for Sub-Agent Invocation

**Current**:
```python
result = delegate_to_mini_orch(orch, incoming_artifact)
```

**Recommended**:
```
> Use the implementation-specialist to handle build.bundle artifact
> with context from plan.snapshot
```

**Implementation**:
1. Remove custom `delegate_to_mini_orch()` function
2. Use natural language Task tool invocation
3. Let Claude Code handle delegation mechanics
4. Trust Task tool's context isolation

**Benefits**:
- Native integration with Claude Code
- Automatic context management
- Parallel execution support
- No custom orchestration logic to maintain

#### R1.2: Simplify to Two-Tier Architecture

**Current**: Master → Mini-Orchestrators (6) → Sub-Agents (25)
**Recommended**: Orchestrator → Specialized Agents (10-15)

**Consolidation Strategy**:
```
DefinitionOrch + Sub-Agents → requirements-analyzer (single agent)
PlanningOrch + Sub-Agents → planning-specialist (single agent)
ImplementationOrch + Sub-Agents → implementation-specialist (single agent)
ReviewTestOrch + Sub-Agents → quality-validator (single agent)
ReleaseOpsOrch + Sub-Agents → deployment-specialist (single agent)
EvolutionOrch + Sub-Agents → evolution-analyst (single agent)
```

**Rationale**:
- Claude Code doesn't impose three-tier pattern
- Simpler agent selection (fewer delegation decisions)
- Each phase = one specialized agent (clearer responsibilities)
- Mini-orchestrators add complexity without value

#### R1.3: Standardize Agent File Format

**Current** (inconsistent):
```markdown
# Agent Name

Some description...
```

**Recommended** (Claude Code standard):
```markdown
---
name: agent-identifier
description: "Specific trigger conditions and capabilities"
tools: Read, Write, Bash, Grep  # Optional
model: sonnet  # Optional
---

# System Prompt

[Role, capabilities, approach, constraints, output format]
```

**Migration Script**:
```python
# For each agent file:
1. Extract name from filename or title
2. Extract description from first paragraph
3. Add YAML frontmatter
4. Keep system prompt content
5. Validate against Claude Code spec
```

### Priority 2: Feature Additions (Enable New Capabilities)

#### R2.1: Implement Skills for Workflow Procedures

**Convert to Skills**:
- Task validation workflows → `task-validation.skill/SKILL.md`
- Work item state transitions → `work-item-lifecycle.skill/SKILL.md`
- CI gate checks → `ci-gate-validation.skill/SKILL.md`
- Context assembly procedures → `context-assembly.skill/SKILL.md`
- Evidence collection workflows → `evidence-gathering.skill/SKILL.md`

**Skill Structure Example**:
```markdown
---
name: Task Validation Workflow
description: "Validates task structure, metadata, acceptance criteria, and compliance. Use when reviewing proposed tasks or checking task quality before acceptance."
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Bash
---

# Task Validation Workflow

## Procedure
1. Read task file
2. Check YAML frontmatter completeness
3. Validate acceptance criteria (≥3)
4. Check effort estimation
5. Verify dependency links
6. Validate against _RULES/TASK_WORKFLOW_RULES.md

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] All required metadata fields present
- [ ] Acceptance criteria count ≥ 3
- [ ] Effort estimate provided
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Compliance with workflow rules

## Output
Validation report with pass/fail and specific issues.
```

**Benefits**:
- Claude can invoke workflows autonomously
- Composable (multiple Skills work together)
- Portable across projects
- Version controlled with code

#### R2.2: Create AIPM Plugin

**Plugin Structure**:
```
aipm-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json
├── agents/
│   ├── requirements-analyzer.md
│   ├── implementation-specialist.md
│   ├── quality-validator.md
│   ├── deployment-specialist.md
│   └── evolution-analyst.md
├── skills/
│   ├── task-validation.skill/SKILL.md
│   ├── work-item-lifecycle.skill/SKILL.md
│   ├── ci-gate-validation.skill/SKILL.md
│   └── context-assembly.skill/SKILL.md
├── commands/
│   ├── task-create.md
│   ├── work-item-start.md
│   └── context-refresh.md
├── hooks/hooks.json
└── .mcp.json (optional - for AIPM database integration)
```

**plugin.json**:
```json
{
  "name": "aipm",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "description": "AI Project Manager - Workflow-driven project management with quality gates",
  "author": {
    "name": "AIPM Team",
    "url": "https://github.com/aipm/aipm-v2"
  },
  "commands": "./commands",
  "agents": "./agents",
  "skills": "./skills",
  "hooks": "./hooks/hooks.json"
}
```

**Distribution**:
- Publish to Claude Code marketplace
- Install via: `claude plugin install aipm`
- Auto-includes all agents, skills, commands, hooks

#### R2.3: Adopt CLAUDE.md Memory System

**Current**: Database queries for context
**Recommended**: Hierarchical CLAUDE.md files

**Structure**:
```
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (global AIPM settings)
/project/.claude/CLAUDE.md (project-wide context)
/project/feature-x/.claude/CLAUDE.md (feature-specific)
/project/.claude/CLAUDE.local.md (personal notes, gitignored)
```

**Content Migration**:
```markdown
# AIPM Project Context

## Project Info
- Name: {project.name}
- Type: {project.project_type}
- Tech Stack: {project.tech_stack}

## Active Work Items
{list of in-progress work items}

## Recent Decisions
{architectural decisions, patterns adopted}

## Standards
{links to _RULES/ directory, coding standards}

## Current Phase
{current workflow phase and gates}
```

**Benefits**:
- Native Claude Code integration
- Version controlled (CLAUDE.md)
- Personal flexibility (CLAUDE.local.md)
- Recursive loading (automatic hierarchy)

### Priority 3: Optimizations (Improve Performance)

#### R3.1: Leverage Checkpointing

**Use Cases**:
- Before major refactoring → create checkpoint
- During exploration → easy rewind
- After each phase gate → automatic checkpoint

**Replace Custom Session Save/Load**:
```bash
# Current: apm session save
# Recommended: Automatic checkpointing + /rewind

# Manual checkpoint (before risky operation):
> I'm about to refactor the authentication system.
> Create a checkpoint so we can rewind if needed.
```

#### R3.2: Use Agent SDK for Custom Tooling

**When to Use**:
- Building standalone AIPM CLI tool
- Creating AIPM web dashboard
- Integrating with external systems (JIRA, GitHub)
- Custom agent orchestration logic

**Example** (TypeScript):
```typescript
import { query, tool } from '@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk';

// Custom tool for AIPM database queries
const aipmDatabase = tool(
  'aipm_database_query',
  'Query AIPM database for work items, tasks, or events',
  z.object({
    query_type: z.enum(['work_item', 'task', 'event']),
    filters: z.object({}).optional()
  }),
  async (args) => {
    // Connect to AIPM database
    // Execute query
    // Return formatted results
  }
);

// Create agent with AIPM context
const result = await query({
  prompt: "Analyze project health",
  options: {
    mcpServers: {
      'aipm-tools': [aipmDatabase]
    },
    agents: {
      'project-analyst': {
        description: "Analyzes AIPM project metrics and health",
        tools: ['Read', 'mcp__aipm-tools__aipm_database_query']
      }
    }
  }
});
```

#### R3.3: Optimize Hooks Integration

**Current**: Custom hook implementations
**Recommended**: Align with Claude Code hook events

**Hook Mapping**:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [{
          "type": "command",
          "command": "aipm context load"
        }]
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write",
        "hooks": [{
          "type": "command",
          "command": "aipm validate-write",
          "timeout": 5
        }]
      }
    ],
    "SubagentStop": [
      {
        "hooks": [{
          "type": "command",
          "command": "aipm log-agent-result"
        }]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [{
          "type": "command",
          "command": "aipm checkpoint-session"
        }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Native event integration
- No custom event bus needed
- Standard hook patterns
- JSON or command-based implementation

## 7. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Areas

**R1: Task Tool Adoption**
- **Risk**: Breaking existing delegation patterns
- **Mitigation**: Incremental migration, keep custom system as fallback initially
- **Testing**: Validate each agent individually before full cutover

**R2: Architecture Simplification**
- **Risk**: Losing phase gate enforcement
- **Mitigation**: Embed gate logic in specialized agents
- **Testing**: Comprehensive gate validation testing

**R3: Memory System Migration**
- **Risk**: Losing database audit trail
- **Mitigation**: Keep database for audit, use CLAUDE.md for context only
- **Testing**: Parallel run (database + CLAUDE.md) during transition

### Medium Risk Areas

**R4: Skills Implementation**
- **Risk**: Model not invoking Skills reliably
- **Mitigation**: Write specific descriptions with clear trigger conditions
- **Testing**: Test with various prompts to ensure activation

**R5: Plugin Distribution**
- **Risk**: Marketplace acceptance criteria
- **Mitigation**: Follow Claude Code plugin guidelines strictly
- **Testing**: Test in multiple environments before publishing

### Low Risk Areas

**R6: Hooks Integration**
- **Risk**: Hook performance overhead
- **Mitigation**: Use lightweight scripts, avoid heavy processing
- **Testing**: Performance benchmarking of hook overhead

**R7: Agent SDK Integration**
- **Risk**: SDK version compatibility
- **Mitigation**: Pin SDK version, follow migration guides
- **Testing**: Test with SDK version updates

## 10. Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Share this analysis** with AIPM team for review and feedback
2. **Prioritize recommendations** based on team capacity and urgency
3. **Create detailed tickets** for Phase 1 work (agent format standardization)
4. **Set up test environment** for validating Task tool adoption
5. **Schedule architecture review** meeting to discuss simplification

### Short-term Actions (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Begin agent migration** (standardize format, test invocations)
2. **Prototype Skills** (convert 1-2 workflows to Skills as proof of concept)
3. **Test Task tool** (validate delegation works with current agents)
4. **Document patterns** (create internal guide for agent/skill creation)
5. **Stakeholder alignment** (ensure buy-in on architecture changes)

### Long-term Actions (Next Quarter)
1. **Complete Phase 1-2** (critical alignments + feature additions)
2. **Publish AIPM plugin** to Claude Code marketplace
3. **User training** on new Skills and agent patterns
4. **Performance optimization** (Phase 3 optimizations)
5. **Continuous improvement** (monitor metrics, iterate based on feedback)

## Conclusion

Claude Code provides a sophisticated, well-designed architecture for building AI agent systems. AIPM's current three-tier orchestration model, while comprehensive, adds complexity that diverges from Claude Code patterns and makes native integration difficult.

**Key Takeaways**:
1. **Task tool is the standard** - use it instead of custom delegation
2. **Skills are powerful** - convert workflows to autonomous capabilities
3. **Simplify architecture** - two tiers (orchestrator + specialized agents) sufficient
4. **Align with standards** - use Claude Code agent format and conventions
5. **Leverage native features** - memory, checkpointing, hooks, plugins

By aligning AIPM with Claude Code architecture, the system will:
- Integrate seamlessly with Claude Code ecosystem
- Reduce maintenance burden (less custom code)
- Improve performance (native context management)
- Enable distribution (via plugin marketplace)
- Future-proof against Claude Code updates

The recommended phased approach (12 weeks) provides a clear path forward with manageable risk and measurable progress. Success depends on team buy-in, incremental migration, and rigorous testing at each phase.

**Status**: Ready for team review and prioritization discussion.
