## üìù Lessons Learned

### What Worked Exceptionally Well ‚úÖ
1. **Parallel orchestration**: 15+ agents, zero conflicts
2. **Quality gates**: Caught incomplete work (WI-35)
3. **Architecture discipline**: Violation detected and fixed immediately
4. **Time-boxing**: All work completed within estimates
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides created alongside code

### What Could Improve ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **AC Management**: No CLI for acceptance criteria (need workaround)
2. **Test Infrastructure**: Some test fixture patterns need update
3. **Bugfix Workflow**: CLI missing command to complete bugfixes in R1 phase
4. **Task Scope Management**: Task #644 scope vs time-box mismatch

### Process Improvements üí°
1. Add CLI command: `apm task acceptance mark-met <id> <criterion>`
2. Add CLI command: `apm work-item complete` for bugfixes at R1 phase
3. Create template for splitting oversized tasks
4. Document "foundation + integration" task pattern

## üéØ Recommendations

### For Next Session
**Priority 1**: Continue WI-114 and WI-116 (momentum is high)
**Priority 2**: Fix Cursor Provider test infrastructure (1-2h)
**Priority 3**: Rescope/split Task #644 (foundation done, integration remains)

### For Long-Term
**Milestone 1**: Complete Memory System MVP (WI-114)
**Milestone 2**: Complete Claude Code Integration (WI-116)
**Milestone 3**: Execute System Readiness Analysis (WI-125-129)
**Milestone 4**: Launch Provider Marketplace (VS Code, Zed, etc.)
