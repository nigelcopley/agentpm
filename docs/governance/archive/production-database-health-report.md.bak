## 4. Ideas Analysis (46 ideas)

### 4.1 Status Distribution

| Status | Count | Percentage | Pipeline Health |
|--------|-------|------------|-----------------|
| idea | 41 | 89.13% | ⚠️ High ideation, low progression |
| converted | 3 | 6.52% | ⚠️ Low conversion rate |
| design | 1 | 2.17% | Minimal design phase |
| research | 1 | 2.17% | Minimal research phase |
| rejected | 0 | 0.00% | ❌ No rejection tracking |

**Issue**: 89% stuck in `idea` state with only 6.52% conversion suggests:
1. Ideas not being actively reviewed/triaged
2. Missing rejection workflow (0 rejections tracked)
3. Backlog accumulation without prioritization

### 4.2 Source Distribution

| Source | Count | Percentage | Diversity |
|--------|-------|------------|-----------|
| user | 25 | 54.35% | User-driven ideation |
| ai_suggestion | 13 | 28.26% | AI contribution |
| brainstorming_session | 8 | 17.39% | Collaborative ideas |

**Good diversity** in idea sources (user, AI, collaborative).

### 4.3 Conversion Metrics

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Total Ideas | 46 | Moderate pipeline |
| Converted to WorkItems | 3 | **6.52% conversion** |
| Rejected | 0 | ❌ No rejection process |
| Active (not converted/rejected) | 43 | ⚠️ 93% pending |
| Has Votes | 3 | ⚠️ Minimal engagement |
| Average Votes | 0.07 | ❌ No voting activity |

**Critical Issues**:
- **6.52% conversion rate** is very low (industry standard: 15-30%)
- **Zero rejections** tracked (suggests no triage/cull process)
- **Zero voting activity** (engagement mechanism unused)

---

## 5. Sessions Analysis (120 sessions)

### 5.1 Tool & Model Distribution

| Tool | Count | Percentage | LLM Model | Count |
|------|-------|------------|-----------|-------|
| claude-code | 120 | 100.00% | (not tracked) | 0 |

**Analysis**: 100% Claude Code usage, but **NO LLM MODEL TRACKING**. This is a critical metadata gap for cost/performance analysis.

### 5.2 Session Type Distribution

| Type | Count | Percentage | Activity Mix |
|------|-------|------------|--------------|
| coding | 120 | 100.00% | ⚠️ No type diversity tracked |

**Issue**: All 120 sessions marked as `coding` suggests:
1. Session type not being set during session start
2. Missing review/planning/research/debugging sessions
3. Workflow discipline gap

### 5.3 Session Metrics

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Total Sessions | 120 | Good activity volume |
| Completed Sessions | 118 | 98.33% completion |
| Active Sessions | 2 | Minimal hanging sessions |
| Has Duration | 118 | 98.33% tracking |
| **Average Duration (min)** | **243.86** | ⚠️ **4+ hours per session** |
| Has Metadata | 120 | 100.00% metadata |

**Critical Finding**: **243.86 minutes (4+ hours) average session duration** suggests:
- Long-running coding sessions
- Possible lack of checkpointing discipline
- Context retention across extended work periods

### 5.4 Metadata Structure (Sample)

**Sample 1** (Work tracking):
```json
{
  "work_items_touched": [78, 77, 46, 44, 25, 74, 35],
  "tasks_completed": [468, 464, 463, 462, 421, 411, ...],
  "git_commits": ["077f7ac", "9e75cdc", "07ea9f1", ...]
}
```

**Metadata Quality**: **EXCELLENT** - Sessions track work_items_touched, tasks_completed, git_commits. Rich audit trail.

## 6. Metadata Quality Cross-Analysis

### 6.1 JSON Structure Adherence

| Entity | Consistent Schema | Freeform Data | Quality Score |
|--------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| work_items.metadata | ⚠️ MIXED | Migration vs rich | 6/10 |
| tasks.quality_metadata | ✅ CONSISTENT | AC + test_plan | 9/10 |
| sessions.metadata | ✅ CONSISTENT | Work tracking | 9/10 |
| ideas.tags | ⚠️ UNUSED | JSON array empty | 3/10 |

**Key Issues**:
1. **work_items.metadata**: Inconsistent - some have rich business context (why_value, scope), others only migration metadata
2. **ideas.tags**: Unused feature (tags field exists but not populated)
3. **Missing JSON validation**: No evidence of Pydantic schema enforcement at write time

### 6.2 Recommended Metadata Schemas

**Work Items** (should enforce):
```json
{
  "why_value": {
    "problem": "string",
    "desired_outcome": "string"
  },
  "scope": {
    "in_scope": ["array"],
    "out_of_scope": ["array"]
  },
  "ownership": {
    "raci": {
      "responsible": "string",
      "accountable": "string"
    }
  }
}
```

**Tasks** (current structure is good):
```json
{
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    {"criterion": "string", "met": "boolean"}
  ],
  "test_plan": "string",
  "tests_passing": "boolean",
  "coverage_percent": "number",
  "submission_notes": "string"
}
```

## 7. Relationship Coverage Analysis

### 7.1 Entity Relationship Matrix

| Relationship | Coverage | Percentage | Density |
|--------------|----------|------------|---------|
| Work Items → Tasks | 80/106 | 75.47% | ✅ HIGH |
| Work Items → Dependencies | 10/106 | 9.43% | ⚠️ LOW |
| Tasks → Dependencies | 23/522 | 4.41% | ⚠️ VERY LOW |
| Work Items → Contexts | 3/106 | 2.83% | ❌ MINIMAL |
| Work Items → Documents | 1/106 | 0.94% | ❌ MINIMAL |
| Tasks → Blockers | 0/522 | 0.00% | ❌ UNUSED |

**Critical Issues**:
1. **Context linkage: 2.83%** - Rich context system exists but almost unused
2. **Document linkage: 0.94%** - Document references not being created
3. **Blocker tracking: 0%** - task_blockers table completely empty despite blocked_reason field usage

### 7.2 Parent-Child Coverage

| Metric | Count | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total Work Items | 106 | - |
| Root Work Items (no parent) | 106 | ⚠️ Flat hierarchy |
| Child Work Items (has parent) | 0 | ❌ No nesting |
| Work Items with Children | 0 | ❌ No decomposition |

**Issue**: **Zero parent-child relationships** suggests work items not being hierarchically organized (epics → features → tasks pattern not used).

### 7.3 Tasks per Work Item Distribution

| Task Count | Work Items | Percentage | Pattern |
|------------|------------|------------|---------|
| 0 tasks | 26 | 24.53% | ⚠️ Unstarted/planning |
| 1 task | 1 | 0.94% | Minimal work |
| 2-3 tasks | 11 | 10.38% | Small features |
| 4-5 tasks | 34 | 32.08% | ✅ Standard features |
| 6-10 tasks | 22 | 20.75% | ✅ Medium features |
| 11-16 tasks | 11 | 10.38% | Large features |
| 28 tasks | 1 | 0.94% | ⚠️ Mega-feature (decompose?) |

**Analysis**: Good distribution, mostly 4-5 tasks per work item. One outlier with 28 tasks may need decomposition.

| Work Items without business_context | 49 | Strategic gap | 🔴 HIGH |
| Work Items without effort_estimate | 57 | Planning gap | ⚠️ MEDIUM |
| Tasks over 4-hour time-box | 30 | Compliance violation | 🔴 HIGH |
| Completed tasks without timestamps | 5 | Audit violation | 🔴 HIGH |

### 8.2 Unused Features

| Feature | Status | Recommendation |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| task_blockers table | Empty | Remove OR enforce usage |
| events table | Empty | Remove OR implement event bus |
| agent_examples table | Empty | Remove OR populate |
| ideas.tags | Unpopulated | Remove OR enforce tagging |
| ideas.votes | Zero activity | Remove OR promote engagement |
| work_item parent-child | Unused | Train users OR simplify model |

### 8.3 Schema Inconsistencies

1. **Metadata structure**: No enforced JSON schema validation
2. **LLM model tracking**: sessions.llm_model always NULL
3. **Session type tracking**: sessions.session_type always 'coding'
4. **Phase field usage**: Only 50% of work items have phase set

---

## 9. Supporting Tables Health

### 9.1 Agents & Rules Tables

| Table | Rows | Health | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| agents | 76 | ✅ GOOD | All agent roles populated |
| rules | 78 | ✅ GOOD | Comprehensive rule coverage |
| agent_relationships | 37 | ✅ GOOD | Agent collaboration mapped |
| agent_tools | 12 | ⚠️ LOW | Limited tool assignments |
| agent_examples | 0 | ❌ EMPTY | Unused feature |

**Rules Distribution by Enforcement**:
- **BLOCK**: 24 rules (critical violations)
- **GUIDE**: 45 rules (recommendations)
- **LIMIT**: 6 rules (constraints)
- **ENHANCE**: 3 rules (optimizations)

### 9.2 Context & Evidence Tables

| Table | Rows | Population | Status |
|-------|------|------------|--------|
| contexts | 10 | MINIMAL | ⚠️ Underutilized |
| work_item_summaries | 10 | MINIMAL | ⚠️ Underutilized |
| document_references | 3 | MINIMAL | ⚠️ Underutilized |
| evidence_sources | 1 | MINIMAL | ⚠️ Underutilized |

**Critical Finding**: Rich context/evidence system exists but nearly unused. Only 3% of work items have context linkage.

---

## 10. Recommendations

### 10.1 Immediate Actions (Critical)

1. **Fix Audit Violations** 🔴
   - 5 completed tasks missing timestamps
   - 30 tasks violating 4-hour time-box
   - Enforce timestamp capture on state transitions

2. **Implement Metadata Schema Validation** 🔴
   - Add Pydantic schema enforcement for work_items.metadata
   - Standardize why_value, scope, ownership structures
   - Reject invalid JSON at write time

3. **Enable Session Metadata Tracking** 🔴
   - Capture llm_model (claude-sonnet-4-5, etc.)
   - Capture actual session_type (coding, review, planning)
   - Track cost/performance metrics

### 10.2 Short-Term Improvements (High Priority)

4. **Improve Context System Usage** ⚠️
   - Train users on context assembly
   - Automate context creation on work item accept
   - Target 50%+ context linkage

5. **Implement Ideas Triage Workflow** ⚠️
   - Review 43 pending ideas
   - Enable rejection workflow (currently 0 rejections)
   - Activate voting/engagement features
   - Target 15-30% conversion rate

6. **Decompose Time-Box Violations** ⚠️
   - Review 30 tasks >4 hours
   - Break into smaller sub-tasks
   - Enforce time-boxing at task creation

7. **Populate Missing Business Context** ⚠️
   - 49 work items without business_context
   - Backfill why_value for active work items
   - Make business_context required for status=ready

### 10.3 Long-Term Enhancements (Medium Priority)

8. **Implement Parent-Child Work Items**
   - Enable epic → feature → sub-feature hierarchy
   - Currently 0% usage (all flat structure)
   - Add UI/CLI support for hierarchical planning

9. **Review Empty Tables**
   - task_blockers: Remove OR enforce usage
   - events: Remove OR implement event bus
   - agent_examples: Remove OR populate with training data

10. **Enhance Dependency Tracking**

    - Only 4.41% tasks have dependencies tracked
    - Automate dependency detection from code analysis

### 10.4 Data Quality Gates (Ongoing)

11. **Enforce Required Fields on State Transitions**
    - draft → ready: Require business_context + effort_estimate
    - ready → active: Require agent assignment
    - active → review: Require quality_metadata
    - review → done: Require timestamps + acceptance_criteria.met=true

12. **Implement Pre-Commit Validation**
    - Validate JSON schema compliance
    - Check time-box violations
    - Ensure timestamp capture
    - Verify metadata completeness
