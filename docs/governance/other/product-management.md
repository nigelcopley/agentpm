# Product Management & Roadmapping Principles

**Purpose**: Product management frameworks for turning insights into strategic bets  
**Audience**: AI agents, product managers, and development teams  
**Scope**: Product strategy, roadmap planning, and outcome-driven development

---

## **ðŸŽ¯ Overview**

Product Management & Roadmapping principles in APM (Agent Project Manager) focus on turning market insights into strategic product bets with clear outcomes, measurable slices, and defined kill criteria. The system ensures all development work serves product strategy and delivers measurable business value.

### **Core Philosophy**

- **Outcome-Driven Development**: Focus on business outcomes, not just features
- **Strategic Betting**: Make informed bets with clear success criteria
- **Measurable Slices**: Break work into measurable, deliverable increments
- **Kill Criteria**: Define clear criteria for stopping or pivoting initiatives
