# Contextual Principle Matrix

**Purpose**: Dynamic principle selection and application based on project context  
**Audience**: AI agents, developers, and project stakeholders  
**Scope**: Context-aware principle weighting and methodology selection

---

## **ðŸŽ¯ Overview**

The Contextual Principle Matrix is the core intelligence system that dynamically selects and applies the most appropriate principles, methodologies, and approaches based on the specific context of each project, work item, and task. This ensures that the right principles are applied in the right situations.

### **Core Philosophy**

- **Context-Driven Selection**: Choose principles based on project characteristics
- **Dynamic Weighting**: Adjust principle importance based on context
- **Intelligent Adaptation**: System learns and improves principle selection
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All business and technical pillars integrated
