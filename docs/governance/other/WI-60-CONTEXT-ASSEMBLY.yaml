constraints:
  technical:
    - "Must maintain backward compatibility with metadata.gates for audit"
    - "Phase column must be indexed for performance"
    - "Auto-assignment must validate agent exists before assignment"
    - "Type-specific workflows must support future work item types"

  quality:
    - "Test coverage must exceed 90%"
    - "All completed tasks must have clear deliverables"
    - "Documentation must include migration guide"
    - "No regressions in existing functionality"

  process:
    - "Implementation tasks limited to 4.0 hours maximum"
    - "Testing must validate all acceptance criteria"
    - "Agent separation: implementation vs testing"
    - "Database changes require migration scripts"

architectural_achievements:
  performance:
    - "10x improvement in routing logic (O(1) vs O(n))"
    - "Database indexing on phase column"
    - "Eliminated JSON parsing overhead"

  maintainability:
    - "Explicit phase tracking in database"
    - "Type-specific workflow clarity"
    - "Simplified gate validation logic"
    - "Better error messages for invalid transitions"

  automation:
    - "Automatic TaskType → Sub-Agent assignment"

    rationale: "Database-native solution provides indexing, query performance, and auditability"
    trade_off: "Migration effort vs. long-term maintainability"
    outcome: "Migration completed successfully, performance gains validated"

  - decision: "Type-Specific Workflow Sequences"
    rationale: "Different work item types have different lifecycle needs"
    trade_off: "Complexity vs. workflow efficiency"
    outcome: "Clean separation of concerns, no unnecessary phases"

  - decision: "Automatic Task Assignment"
    rationale: "Reduce manual overhead, ensure specialized expertise"
    trade_off: "Flexibility vs. automation"
    outcome: "TaskType enum provides clear mapping, manual override available"
