# Idea 48 Proposal – Structured Idea Breakdown

**Agent:** Project Manager / QA Lead / Finance Analyst

## Who will implement it?
- **Primary Team:** Workflow Engineering (Responsible)
- **Supporting Agents:** CLI tooling specialist, Migration engineer, QA automation, Documentation team.
- **RACI:**
  - Responsible: workflow-team
  - Accountable: platform-lead
  - Consulted: documentation-team, qa-lead
  - Informed: engineering-org

## When will it be executed?
- Target window: Q4 2025 planning cycle.
- Estimated effort: 20 hours (Design 4h, Implementation 12h, Testing 4h).
- Suggested milestones: schema migration → CLI support → conversion enhancements → QA/docs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Ideas expose structured parts via CLI, with validation at each lifecycle gate.
2. Conversion to a work item generates metadata, tasks, and attaches idea documents.
3. Legacy ideas remain accessible (fallback empty parts, migration script).
4. Documentation updated to explain the structured idea workflow.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Migration complexity:** Provide default placeholders and migration tooling.
- **User adoption:** Publish a guide with examples and CLI prompts; run internal demo.
- **Conversion regressions:** Ensure automated tests cover idea→work-item flow.

## Decision Checklist (for next phase)
- All prior parts reviewed and approved.
- Stakeholders acknowledge the timeline and effort.
- No blocking questions outstanding.
