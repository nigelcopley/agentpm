# WI-77 â€“ Document Management CLI Commands

## Context
- CLI stubs exist under `agentpm/cli/commands/document/` (add, list, show, update, delete) but work item remains in progress with tasks still `proposed`.
- Backend support is provided by `agentpm/core/database/methods/document_references.py` and the `DocumentReference` model; CLI needs to surface these operations with validation and formatting.

## Observations
- Commands currently lack comprehensive tests and documentation.
- There is no dedicated guide for users on managing document references via CLI.
- Requires design/implementation/testing/doc tasks to be executed.
