# Objectives Command Removal - Documentation Update Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Task**: Document objectives command removal
**Status**: COMPLETED

## Changes Made

### 1. Migration Guide Created
**File**: `/Users/nigelcopley/.project_manager/aipm-v2/docs/migrations/objectives-command-removal.md`

**Contents**:
- Summary of change and rationale
- Commands removed (apm objectives add/list)
- Migration paths (3 options)
- Data migration notes (no migration needed)
- Alternative access patterns
- Benefits of removal
- References to related documentation

**Key Points**:
- Breaking change at CLI level only
- Full backward compatibility at database level
- All existing objectives remain as WorkItems with type=OBJECTIVE
- Agent-first design (orchestrators handle objective management)

### 2. Migration Directory README
**File**: `/Users/nigelcopley/.project_manager/aipm-v2/docs/migrations/README.md`

**Contents**:
- Purpose of migrations directory
- Active migrations list
- Migration document format guidelines
- Version history

### 3. CLAUDE.md Updates (aipm-cli version)
**File**: `/Users/nigelcopley/.project_manager/CLAUDE.md`

**Changes**:
- Removed `apm objectives list` from Quick System Commands section (line 205)
- Removed `apm objectives add "goal"` and `apm objectives list` from Essential Commands section (lines 315-316)
- Added note explaining objectives are now managed as WorkItems with reference to migration guide (lines 319-320)
- Updated system status from "All 8 CLI Commands" to "Core CLI Commands" (line 175)

### 4. APM Command Audit Report Updates
**File**: `/Users/nigelcopley/.project_manager/aipm-v2/APM_COMMAND_AUDIT_REPORT.md`

**Changes**:
- Executive summary: Changed "3 Missing Features" to "2 Missing Features (1 resolved as intentional change)" (line 15)
- Section 10: Renamed "Missing Feature #2" to "✅ Resolved: Objectives Commands Removed (Intentional)" (line 463)
- Added detailed rationale, current approach, migration guide reference, and benefits (lines 465-493)
- Recommendations section: Marked "Restore Objectives Commands" as ✅ RESOLVED with documentation references (lines 610-614)

## Documentation Structure

```
docs/
└── migrations/
    ├── README.md (NEW - migration directory overview)
    └── objectives-command-removal.md (NEW - detailed migration guide)

CLAUDE.md (UPDATED - removed objectives references, added migration note)
APM_COMMAND_AUDIT_REPORT.md (UPDATED - marked as resolved, added details)
OBJECTIVES-COMMAND-REMOVAL-SUMMARY.md (NEW - this file)
```

## Benefits Documented

1. **Reduced CLI Surface**: Fewer commands to maintain
2. **Unified Data Model**: Single WorkItem interface for all work types
3. **Agent-First Design**: Orchestrators handle objective management logic
4. **Better Relationships**: Objectives link to tasks/features through WorkItem associations
5. **Lifecycle Consistency**: All work items follow same state transitions

## Alternative Access Patterns

### Option 1: Database API

```python
from agentpm.core.database.service import DatabaseService

db = DatabaseService()
work_item = db.create_work_item(
    title="Implement authentication system",
    type="OBJECTIVE",
    status="PROPOSED"
)
```

### Option 2: Agent Delegation
```
# Master Orchestrator delegates to DefinitionOrch
delegate -> DefinitionOrch.process_raw_request(
    request="Implement authentication system",
    item_type="OBJECTIVE"
)
```

### Option 3: Status Command
```bash
# View project objectives in dashboard
apm status  # Shows objectives in System Status section
```
