# Security, Privacy & Compliance Principles

**Purpose**: Comprehensive security, privacy, and compliance frameworks for secure development  
**Audience**: AI agents, security teams, and development teams  
**Scope**: Threat modeling, SDL, data classification, SOC2/GDPR-by-design

## **üéØ Overview**

Security, Privacy & Compliance principles in APM (Agent Project Manager) ensure that all development work follows security-by-design principles, maintains privacy protection, and meets regulatory compliance requirements. The system provides comprehensive security guidance that integrates throughout the development lifecycle.

### **Core Philosophy**

- **Security by Design**: Security integrated from the beginning, not bolted on
- **Privacy by Default**: Privacy protection built into every component
- **Compliance by Design**: Regulatory requirements integrated into architecture
- **Threat-Aware Development**: Continuous threat modeling and risk assessment
