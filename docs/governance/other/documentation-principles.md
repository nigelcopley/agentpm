# Documentation Principles

**Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation standards and practices for APM (Agent Project Manager)  
**Audience**: AI agents, developers, technical writers, and contributors  
**Scope**: Documentation-as-code, decision logs (ADRs/RFCs), runbooks, and knowledge management

---

## **üéØ Overview**

Documentation principles in APM (Agent Project Manager) ensure that all knowledge is captured, maintained, and accessible in a structured, consistent manner. The system treats documentation as a first-class citizen, with comprehensive standards for creation, maintenance, and consumption by both humans and AI agents.

### **Core Philosophy**

- **Documentation as Code**: Version-controlled, reviewable, and maintainable documentation
- **Living Documentation**: Continuously updated and validated documentation
- **Agent-Optimised**: Structured for AI agent consumption and understanding
- **Decision-Driven**: All major decisions documented with rationale and context
