## **📊 Current State Assessment**

### **What We Have (Strong Foundation)**
- ✅ **Complete database rules infrastructure** (schema, models, methods)
- ✅ **Sophisticated rules system** (260 rules, YAML catalog, presets)
- ✅ **Interactive questionnaire** for rule selection during `apm init`
- ✅ **Working context assembly system** with confidence scoring
- ✅ **Quality gates and workflow enforcement**
- ✅ **Plugin architecture** for framework detection
- ✅ **CLI interface** with Rich formatting
- ✅ **Comprehensive principles documentation**

### **What We Need (Gaps to Fill)**
- ❌ **Principles not integrated into rules system** (comprehensive principles documented but not in rules catalog)
- ❌ **Database rules not fully utilized** (validators still use hardcoded constants)
- ❌ **No multi-agent analysis pipeline** (comprehensive idea assessment)
- ❌ **No contextual principle matrix** (dynamic principle selection)
- ❌ **Limited business intelligence** (market research, competitive analysis)
