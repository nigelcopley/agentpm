# Data & Analytics Principles

**Purpose**: Comprehensive data and analytics frameworks for evidence-based development  
**Audience**: AI agents, data teams, and development teams  
**Scope**: Single source of truth, event taxonomy, experimentation, privacy-aware metrics

## **ðŸŽ¯ Overview**

Data & Analytics principles in APM (Agent Project Manager) ensure that all development work is driven by data, measured with privacy-aware metrics, and validated through systematic experimentation. The system provides comprehensive analytics guidance that enables evidence-based decision making throughout the development lifecycle.

### **Core Philosophy**

- **Single Source of Truth**: Centralised, authoritative data sources
- **Event-Driven Analytics**: Comprehensive event taxonomy and tracking
- **Experimentation Culture**: Systematic A/B testing and validation
- **Privacy-Aware Metrics**: Analytics that respect user privacy and consent
