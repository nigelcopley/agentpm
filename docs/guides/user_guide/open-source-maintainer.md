# User Journey: Open Source Maintainer

**User Profile:** Maria, 32, Maintainer of popular open source project  
**Project:** Web framework with 50K+ stars, 200+ contributors  
**AI Usage:** Daily with Claude Code, occasional Aider for git workflows  
**Project Size:** 100K+ LOC, growing rapidly  
**Timeline:** 2 years of maintenance, planning major v3.0 release

---

## Stage 1: Discovery & Installation (Day 1)

### The Problem
Maria maintains a popular web framework with 200+ contributors. She's constantly dealing with:
- **Context Loss:** New contributors re-ask the same questions
- **Decision Amnesia:** "Why did we choose this architecture?"
- **Knowledge Silos:** Core maintainers hold critical decisions
- **Onboarding Friction:** New contributors take weeks to understand the project

**Pain Point:** 30+ minutes per day just explaining project context to new contributors.

### Discovery
Maria sees a GitHub issue: "APM (Agent Project Manager): Context persistence for open source projects"

**Research Process:**
1. Visits GitHub: `github.com/agentpm/aipm`
2. Reads README: "Local-first context persistence for AI coding assistants"
3. Checks open source compatibility: "MIT license, works with any AI tool"
4. Reviews community feedback: "Helps with large codebases"

### Installation
```bash
# Simple installation
pip install aipm-v2

# Initialize in her project
cd /workspace/web-framework
apm init "Web Framework v3.0"

🤖 APM (Agent Project Manager) initialized for Web Framework v3.0
📋 Context system ready
🔧 Hooks installed for Claude Code
✅ Ready to use!
```

### Initial Context Capture
```bash
# Capture project history and decisions
apm learnings record --type=decision \
  --content="Framework uses plugin architecture for extensibility" \
  --rationale="Allows community to extend without modifying core" \
  --evidence="https://github.com/web-framework/docs/architecture" \
  --confidence=0.95

apm learnings record --type=decision \
  --content="TypeScript for type safety, JavaScript for compatibility" \
  --rationale="Type safety for development, JavaScript for adoption" \
  --evidence="https://github.com/web-framework/issues/1234" \
  --confidence=0.90

apm learnings record --type=pattern \
  --content="Plugin pattern: Core + Extensions" \
  --code-example="
// Plugin pattern
class Plugin {
  constructor(name, options) {
    this.name = name;
    this.options = options;
  }
  
  install(app) {
    // Plugin installation logic
  }
}
  " \
  --when-to-use="All framework extensions should follow this pattern"
```

**Time Investment:** 30 minutes  
**Immediate Value:** None yet (setup phase)

## Stage 2: First Session with Context (Day 2)

### The Experience
Maria starts her morning maintenance session:

```bash
# She opens Claude Code as usual
claude

# AIPM hook runs automatically
🤖 APM (Agent Project Manager) Session Started
📋 Active Work Item: Framework Maintenance
🎯 Current Task: Review pull request #2341

Context loaded:
  Project: Web Framework v3.0
  Tech Stack: TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, npm
  Architecture: Plugin-based, modular design
  Previous Decisions: 3 decisions loaded
  Active Files: src/core/plugin.ts, src/types/index.ts
  Recent PRs: 5 open, 12 merged this week

Ready to continue work!
```

### The Magic Moment
Maria realizes she doesn't need to explain the project context. Claude Code already knows:
- The plugin architecture
- TypeScript/JavaScript dual approach
- Recent pull request history
- Current maintenance priorities

**Time Saved:** 15 minutes (no context re-explanation needed)

### Work Session
Maria works for 2 hours reviewing PRs and making decisions. At the end:

```bash
# Session ends, AIPM captures learnings
apm session end

✅ Session ended (2h 30m)
📝 Learnings captured:
  - Decision: Accept PR #2341 (plugin validation improvements)
  - Pattern: Plugin validation should use schema-based approach
  - Discovery: New contributor @alex submitted high-quality PR
  - Files modified: src/core/plugin.ts, tests-BAK/plugin.test.ts

Context updated for next session.
```

**Value Realized:** Context persistence works for open source maintenance!
