# User Journey: Enterprise Team Migrating Legacy System

**User Profile:** TechCorp Enterprise Team (15 developers, 3 time zones)  
**Project:** Legacy monolith migration to microservices  
**AI Usage:** Mixed (Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, GitHub Copilot)  
**Project Size:** 500K+ LOC legacy system  
**Timeline:** 18 months migration project  
**Compliance:** SOC 2, GDPR, PCI DSS required

---

## Stage 1: Enterprise Evaluation & Procurement (Week 1-2)

### The Challenge
TechCorp's legacy e-commerce platform (500K+ LOC, 15 years old) needs migration to microservices. The team is struggling with:
- **Context Loss:** Each developer re-explains the legacy system
- **Decision Inconsistency:** Different teams make conflicting architectural decisions
- **Compliance Gaps:** No audit trail for architectural decisions
- **Knowledge Silos:** Senior developers hold critical system knowledge

### Enterprise Evaluation
**CTO Decision Process:**
1. **Compliance Review:** APM (Agent Project Manager) meets SOC 2, GDPR requirements
2. **Security Assessment:** Local-first architecture, no data leaves premises
3. **ROI Analysis:** 2+ hours saved per developer per day = $200K+ annual savings
4. **Pilot Program:** 3-month trial with 5 developers

### Procurement & Setup
```bash
# Enterprise installation
pip install aipm-v2[enterprise]

# Initialize enterprise project
cd /workspace/techcorp-legacy-migration
apm init "Legacy E-Commerce Migration" --compliance=soc2,gdpr,pci

🤖 APM (Agent Project Manager) Enterprise initialized
📋 Compliance mode: SOC 2, GDPR, PCI DSS
🔐 Security: Local-first, encrypted storage
📊 Audit trail: Enabled
✅ Ready for enterprise use
```

### Enterprise Configuration
```bash
# Set up enterprise rules
apm rules set --compliance=soc2
apm rules set --audit-trail=enabled
apm rules set --evidence-required=high-risk-decisions

# Create enterprise work items
apm work-item create "Legacy System Analysis" --type=feature --priority=critical
apm work-item create "Microservices Architecture Design" --type=feature --priority=high
apm work-item create "Data Migration Strategy" --type=feature --priority=high
apm work-item create "API Gateway Implementation" --type=feature --priority=medium
```

**Time Investment:** 2 days (procurement, setup, training)  
**Immediate Value:** None yet (evaluation phase)

---

## Stage 2: Pilot Team Onboarding (Week 3-4)

### The Pilot Team
- **Sarah (Senior Architect):** Claude Code for architecture decisions
- **Mike (Backend Lead):** Cursor for implementation
- **Lisa (DevOps):** Aider for infrastructure automation

  " \
  --when-to-use="Legacy system only, not for new microservices"
```
