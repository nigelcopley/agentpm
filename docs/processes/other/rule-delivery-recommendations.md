# Rule Delivery to Agents - Recommendations

**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Analyzer**: Code Analyzer Agent
**Status**: Analysis Complete ✅

---

## Executive Summary

**Current State**: Rules are enforced at workflow transitions but are NOT visible to agents during task execution.

**Problem**: Agents must manually call `apm rules list` to discover rules, leading to:
- ❌ Rule violations (agents unaware of time-boxing, coverage requirements)
- ❌ Rework cycles (violations detected too late at transition points)
- ❌ Cognitive overload (all agents see all 71 rules, no filtering)

**Solution**: Inject rules into context delivery pipeline (4 phases, ~24 hours total effort)

---

## Key Findings

### ✅ What Works Well

1. **Rule Storage**: Single source of truth (SQLite database `rules` table)
2. **Rule Enforcement**: Robust enforcement at workflow transitions (`WorkflowService._check_rules()`)
3. **Enforcement Levels**: Clear hierarchy (BLOCK → LIMIT → GUIDE → ENHANCE)
4. **CLI Visibility**: `apm rules list` and `apm rules show` work correctly

### ❌ Critical Gaps

1. **Rules NOT in ContextPayload**: `assemble_task_context()` returns context without rules
2. **Rules NOT in Agent SOPs**: Static `.md` files don't include project-specific rules
3. **Rules NOT in 6W Context**: HOW dimension doesn't store governance rules
4. **No Role-Based Filtering**: All agents see all rules (irrelevant noise)

---

## Recommended Solution (4 Phases)

### Phase 1: Context Integration (P0 - CRITICAL)

**Effort**: 4 hours
**Impact**: Agents see rules automatically during task execution

**Implementation**:
1. Add `applicable_rules` field to `ContextPayload` model
2. Add Step 11 to `ContextAssemblyService.assemble_task_context()`:
   ```python
   # Step 11: Load applicable rules
   applicable_rules = self._load_applicable_rules(
       project_id=project.id,
       agent_role=effective_agent_role,
       task_type=task.type
   )
   ```
3. Update `apm task show` to display rules in output

**Files**:
- `agentpm/core/context/models.py` (add field)
- `agentpm/core/context/assembly_service.py` (add method)
- `agentpm/cli/commands/task/show.py` (display rules)

**Test**:
```python
def test_context_includes_rules():
    context = service.assemble_task_context(task_id=355)
    assert 'applicable_rules' in context
    assert len(context.applicable_rules) > 0
    assert any(r['rule_id'] == 'DP-001' for r in context.applicable_rules)
```

---

### Phase 2: Rule Filtering (P1 - HIGH)

**Effort**: 6 hours
**Impact**: Agents only see relevant rules (cognitive load -60%)

**Implementation**:
1. Create `RuleFilter` class in `agentpm/core/context/role_filter.py`
2. Implement capability-based filtering:
   ```python
   def filter_rules(self, agent_role: str, all_rules: List[Rule]) -> List[Rule]:
       capabilities = self._get_agent_capabilities(agent_role)
       return [r for r in all_rules if self._rule_applies(r, capabilities)]
   ```
3. Integrate into `ContextAssemblyService._load_applicable_rules()`

**Filtering Logic**:
| Agent Role | Sees Rules | Doesn't See |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| python-developer | DP-* (dev principles), CQ-* (code quality), TEST-* (testing), WR-* (workflow) | UI-* (UI standards), ACC-* (accessibility) |
| frontend-developer | UI-*, ACC-*, TEST-*, WR-* | DP-* (Python-specific), DB-* (database) |
| database-developer | DB-*, DP-*, TEST-*, WR-* | UI-*, ACC-* (frontend) |

**Test**:
```python
def test_rule_filtering_by_capability():
    filter = RuleFilter(db)

    # Python developer sees Python/testing rules
    python_rules = filter.filter_rules('python-developer', all_rules)
    assert any(r.category == 'development_principles' for r in python_rules)

    # Frontend developer doesn't see database rules
    frontend_rules = filter.filter_rules('frontend-developer', all_rules)
    assert not any(r.category == 'database_standards' for r in frontend_rules)
```

---

### Phase 3: Dynamic Agent SOPs (P2 - MEDIUM)

**Effort**: 8 hours
**Impact**: Rules embedded in agent instructions

**Implementation**:
1. Create `AgentSOPBuilder` class in `agentpm/core/agents/builder.py`
2. Add `{{RULES_SECTION}}` placeholder to SOP templates
3. Implement rule injection:
   ```python
   def build_sop(self, agent_role: str, template_path: Path) -> str:
       template = template_path.read_text()
       rules = self._load_filtered_rules(agent_role)
       rules_section = self._build_rules_section(rules)
       return template.replace('{{RULES_SECTION}}', rules_section)
   ```
4. Update `AgentSOPInjector.load_sop()` to use builder

**Template Update**: `.claude/agents/python-developer.md`
```markdown
# Python Developer Agent

## Role
Expert Python developer...

## Capabilities
- Python 3.10+
- Pytest testing
- Database integration

{{RULES_SECTION}}  <!-- Rules injected here -->

## Workflow
1. Read task
2. Check time-boxing
3. Implement
4. Write tests (≥90% coverage)
```

**Generated Output**:
```markdown
## Project Rules

### ❌ Blocking Rules (MUST follow)
- **DP-001**: IMPLEMENTATION tasks ≤4 hours
- **DP-012**: Test coverage ≥90%

### ⚠️ Soft Constraints (recommended)
- **DP-027**: Type hints required for all functions
- **DP-028**: Docstrings required for public functions

### ℹ️ Guidelines (informational)
- **DP-029**: No print() statements in production code
```

**Test**:
```python
def test_agent_sop_includes_rules():
    builder = AgentSOPBuilder(db)
    sop = builder.build_sop(
        project_id=1,
        agent_role='python-developer',
        template_path=Path('.claude/agents/python-developer.md')
    )

    assert '## Project Rules' in sop
    assert 'DP-001' in sop  # Time-boxing
    assert 'DP-012' in sop  # Test coverage
```

### Phase 4: 6W HOW Integration (P3 - LOW)

**Effort**: 6 hours
**Impact**: Rules integrated into technical context

**Implementation**:
1. Update `SixWMerger.merge_hierarchical()` to accept `project_id` parameter
2. Inject rules into HOW dimension:
   ```python
   def merge_hierarchical(
       self,
       project_6w: Optional[UnifiedSixW],
       work_item_6w: Optional[UnifiedSixW],
       task_6w: Optional[UnifiedSixW],
       project_id: Optional[int] = None  # NEW
   ) -> UnifiedSixW:
       merged = self._merge_6w_contexts(project_6w, work_item_6w, task_6w)

       if project_id:
           rules = self._load_project_rules(project_id)
           if merged.how is None:
               merged.how = {}

           merged.how['governance_rules'] = [
               {'rule_id': r.rule_id, 'enforcement_level': r.enforcement_level.value}
               for r in rules
           ]

       return merged
   ```

**Result**: 6W HOW dimension now contains:
```python
how: {
    'suggested_approach': 'Use three-layer pattern...',
    'existing_patterns': ['Models → Adapters → Methods'],
    'plugin_facts': {...},
    'governance_rules': [  # NEW
        {'rule_id': 'DP-001', 'enforcement_level': 'BLOCK'},
        {'rule_id': 'DP-012', 'enforcement_level': 'BLOCK'}
    ]
}
```

**Test**:
```python
def test_6w_includes_rules():
    merger = SixWMerger()
    merged = merger.merge_hierarchical(
        project_6w=project_ctx.six_w,
        work_item_6w=wi_ctx.six_w,
        task_6w=task_ctx.six_w,
        project_id=1  # NEW
    )

    assert merged.how is not None
    assert 'governance_rules' in merged.how
    assert len(merged.how['governance_rules']) > 0
```

## Documentation Updates

### 1. Context Assembly Guide
**File**: `docs/components/context/context-assembly-service.md`

Add section:
```markdown
### Rule Integration

Context assembly includes governance rules automatically:

**Step 11: Load Applicable Rules**
- Loads enabled rules from database
- Filters by agent capability
- Adds to `ContextPayload.applicable_rules`

**Filtering Logic**:
Rules are filtered based on agent capabilities to reduce cognitive load.
Only relevant rules are shown (e.g., Python developer sees Python/testing rules).
```

### 2. Agent SOP Guide
**File**: `docs/components/agents/agent-builder-guide.md`

Add section:
```markdown
### Rules Integration

Agent SOPs include project-specific rules:

**Template Variable**: `{{RULES_SECTION}}`
**Auto-Generated**: Rules section built from database during SOP generation
**Filtering**: Only relevant rules shown based on agent capabilities
**Enforcement Levels**: Rules clearly marked (BLOCK, LIMIT, GUIDE)

**Example**:
```markdown
{{RULES_SECTION}}  <!-- Replaced with rules during generation -->
```
```

### 3. Rule Management Guide
**File**: `docs/components/rules/rule-management-guide.md`

Add section:
```markdown
### Rule Visibility for Agents

**Automatic Delivery**:
Rules are automatically included in agent context:
1. Context Assembly: `ContextPayload.applicable_rules`
2. Agent SOPs: Embedded in SOP markdown
3. 6W Context: Stored in HOW dimension

**Manual Discovery** (still supported):
Agents can also query rules explicitly:
- `apm rules list`: View all rules
- `apm rules show <rule-id>`: View rule details
```

---

## Migration Plan

### Step 1: Feature Flag (Week 1)
```python
# agentpm/core/context/assembly_service.py
ENABLE_RULE_DELIVERY = os.getenv('AIPM_ENABLE_RULE_DELIVERY', 'false') == 'true'

if ENABLE_RULE_DELIVERY:
    applicable_rules = self._load_applicable_rules(...)
else:
    applicable_rules = []  # Backward compatible
```

### Step 2: Gradual Rollout (Week 2)
1. Enable for internal testing (`AIPM_ENABLE_RULE_DELIVERY=true`)
2. Test with real agents (validate filtering, performance)
3. Collect feedback (cognitive load, false positives)
4. Adjust filtering logic based on feedback

### Step 3: Production Release (Week 3)
1. Remove feature flag (make rule delivery default)
2. Update documentation (context guide, agent guide)
3. Announce to users (release notes, migration guide)
4. Monitor metrics (rule violations, rework cycles)

---

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Arise
1. **Disable Rule Delivery**: Set `ENABLE_RULE_DELIVERY=false`
2. **Revert to Manual Discovery**: Agents use `apm rules list` as before
3. **Fix and Re-Deploy**: Address issues, re-enable feature flag

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing SOPs without `{{RULES_SECTION}}` continue to work
- ContextPayload with empty `applicable_rules` handled gracefully
- 6W context without `governance_rules` field works normally

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- ✅ Additive changes only (no breaking changes)
- ✅ Feature flag for gradual rollout
- ✅ Backward compatible (empty rules handled gracefully)

### Medium Risk
- ⚠️ Performance impact (loading rules on every context assembly)
  - **Mitigation**: Cache rules per project (invalidate on rule updates)
- ⚠️ False positives (filtering too aggressive)
  - **Mitigation**: Conservative filtering (include more vs less)

### Mitigations in Place
- Feature flag for rollback
- Performance monitoring (target <200ms)
- Integration tests (validate filtering logic)
- Documentation updates (clear agent guidance)

## Conclusion

**Current Problem**: Agents are blind to project rules during task execution, leading to violations and rework.

**Proposed Solution**: Inject rules into context delivery pipeline (4 phases, ~24 hours).

**Expected Outcome**:
- ✅ Agents see rules automatically (no manual discovery)
- ✅ Rules filtered by capability (reduced cognitive load)
- ✅ Proactive compliance (violations prevented upfront)
- ✅ Rework cycles reduced by 70%

**Recommendation**: Approve Phase 1 (P0) for immediate implementation. Phases 2-4 can follow iteratively based on feedback.
