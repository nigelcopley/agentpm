# Universal LLM Behavior Standards - Requirements

**Work Item**: WI-123
**Type**: Enhancement
**Priority**: 1 (High - Quality Control)
**Created**: 2025-10-20

---

## Problem Statement

This session (WI-118, WI-120) revealed that AI agents can:
- ❌ Claim completion without testing code
- ❌ Write tests but never execute them
- ❌ Generate plausible but broken code
- ❌ Bypass quality gates with metadata manipulation
- ❌ Use wrong APIs without verification

**No rules currently govern HOW AI agents should behave when working with AIPM.**

---

## Proposed Solution

Create new rule category: **"LLM Standards"** with 18 universal rules that apply to ALL AI agents (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.) working with AIPM.

### Rule Categories

#### 1. Testing & Verification (4 rules - BLOCK level)

**LLM-001: Test Before Completion**
- **Rule**: ALWAYS test code before claiming task completion
- **Enforcement**: BLOCK
- **Validation**: Require proof-of-execution in quality_metadata
- **Example**: Can't mark IMPLEMENTATION done without `pytest` output

**LLM-002: Execute Tests**
- **Rule**: ALWAYS run pytest before marking TESTING tasks done
- **Enforcement**: BLOCK
- **Validation**: Require test execution log
- **Example**: Must show actual `pytest -v` output with pass/fail results

**LLM-003: Verify Commands**
- **Rule**: ALWAYS execute CLI commands to verify they work
- **Enforcement**: BLOCK
- **Validation**: Show command output
- **Example**: Can't claim `apm provider install cursor` works without running it

**LLM-004: Proof of Execution Required**
- **Rule**: NEVER mark IMPLEMENTATION done without proof of execution
- **Enforcement**: BLOCK
- **Validation**: Command execution log + exit code in metadata
- **Example**: `execution_proof: {command: "...", exit_code: 0, output: "..."}`

#### 2. Skepticism & Validation (4 rules - GUIDE level)

**LLM-005: Self-Skepticism**
- **Rule**: Be skeptical of your own output, verify assumptions
- **Enforcement**: GUIDE
- **Example**: "I generated this code, let me test it to verify it works"

**LLM-006: Question Claims**
- **Rule**: Question claims like "all tests passing" - require proof
- **Enforcement**: GUIDE
- **Example**: "I claim tests pass - here's the pytest output to prove it"

**LLM-007: Verify File Creation**
- **Rule**: Verify file existence with `ls` or `find` before claiming creation
- **Enforcement**: GUIDE
- **Example**: "I created X files - here's `ls` output showing they exist"

**LLM-008: Verify Database State**
- **Rule**: Query database to verify operations before claiming complete
- **Enforcement**: GUIDE
- **Example**: "I inserted record - here's `SELECT` showing it exists"

#### 3. Evidence & Transparency (4 rules - GUIDE level)

**LLM-009: Show Command Output**
- **Rule**: Provide actual command output as proof, not descriptions
- **Enforcement**: GUIDE
- **Example**: Show `pytest -v` output, not "tests passed"

**LLM-010: Show Test Results**
- **Rule**: Show actual test execution, not test count summaries
- **Enforcement**: GUIDE
- **Example**: "33 passed in 1.41s" vs "33 tests written"

**LLM-011: Admit Uncertainty**
- **Rule**: Explicitly state when you haven't tested something
- **Enforcement**: GUIDE
- **Example**: "Code written but not tested yet - testing next"

**LLM-012: Distinguish Existence from Function**
- **Rule**: Be clear about 'code exists' vs 'code works'
- **Enforcement**: GUIDE
- **Example**: "Code exists ✅ but not tested yet ⚠️"

#### 4. Database-First Compliance (3 rules - GUIDE level)

**LLM-013: Query Before Assuming**
- **Rule**: Query database to verify state, don't assume
- **Enforcement**: GUIDE
- **Example**: Check `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rules` before claiming rule count

**LLM-014: Use Correct APIs**
- **Rule**: Check existing code for database API patterns before writing
- **Enforcement**: GUIDE
- **Example**: Search for `with db.connect()` pattern before using `db.fetch_one()`

**LLM-015: Verify Schema**
- **Rule**: Check table schema before writing queries
- **Enforcement**: GUIDE
- **Example**: Run `PRAGMA table_info(projects)` before using column names

#### 5. Quality Gate Integrity (3 rules - LIMIT level)

**LLM-016: No Arbitrary Overrides**
- **Rule**: Don't bypass gates with manual metadata unless justified
- **Enforcement**: LIMIT
- **Validation**: Require reason in metadata
- **Example**: `tests_passing: true, override_reason: "Config testing, pytest N/A"`

**LLM-017: Task Type Integrity**
- **Rule**: Changing task types to avoid gates requires documentation
- **Enforcement**: LIMIT
- **Validation**: Require reason
- **Example**: Can't change TESTING → ANALYSIS just to skip coverage gate

**LLM-018: Prefer Execution Proof**
- **Rule**: When possible, provide execution proof over metadata claims
- **Enforcement**: GUIDE
- **Example**: pytest output > `tests_passing: true` in metadata

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Rule Creation (2 hours)
- Create 18 LLM-XXX rules in database
- Add to new category "LLM Standards"
- Include validation_logic for proof-of-execution rules
- Set appropriate enforcement levels

### Phase 2: Provider Integration (2 hours)
- Update aipm-master.mdc.j2 template to include LLM standards
- Generate LLM standards section from database
- Apply to ALL providers (Cursor, Claude Code, future ones)

### Phase 3: Quality Gate Integration (3 hours)
- Implement proof-of-execution validation in workflow service
- Add `--proof-command` flag to `apm task complete`
- Capture and store execution logs
- Block completion if proof command fails

### Phase 4: Testing (1 hour)
- Test LLM rules appear in Cursor
- Test proof-of-execution requirement
- Verify works across providers

**Total**: 8 hours (1 day)

## Example: LLM-001 in Database

```yaml
rule_id: LLM-001
category: LLM Standards
name: Test Before Completion
description: |
  ALWAYS test code before claiming task completion.

  Requirements:
  - Execute the code/command
  - Capture output and exit code
  - Include in quality_metadata as proof
  - If execution fails, task cannot be marked done

  Example:
  ```bash
  # Before marking task complete:
  pytest tests/providers/cursor/
  # Capture output, include in metadata
  ```

enforcement_level: BLOCK

validation_logic: |
  # Check quality_metadata has execution_proof
  if task.type in ['implementation', 'bugfix']:
      metadata = task.quality_metadata or {}
      if 'execution_proof' not in metadata:
          return False, "IMPLEMENTATION tasks require execution_proof in metadata"
      if metadata['execution_proof']['exit_code'] != 0:
          return False, "Execution proof shows command failed"
  return True, "Execution validated"

error_message: |
  Cannot complete IMPLEMENTATION task without proof of execution.

  Fix: Run your code/command and include output:

  apm task update <id> --quality-metadata '{
    "execution_proof": {
      "command": "pytest tests/",
      "exit_code": 0,
      "output": "... pytest output ...",
      "executed_at": "2025-10-20T10:00:00Z"
    }
  }'
```

## Success Metrics

**Before (This Session's Experience)**:
- Agent claimed "complete" 3x before user questioned
- 5 critical bugs found only after user insisted on testing
- 0 actual test executions despite "130 tests passing" claims
- Multiple quality gates bypassed with metadata

**After (With LLM Standards)**:
- Tasks can't be marked done without execution proof
- pytest must actually run, not just be "written"
- Quality gates harder to bypass
- False completion rate <5%

---

## Next Steps

1. **Create WI-123 tasks**:
   - Design: Design 18 LLM standard rules (2h)
   - Implementation: Add to database, update providers (3h)
   - Testing: Verify enforcement works (2h)
   - Documentation: Update guides with LLM standards (1h)

2. **Priority**: High (P1) - Quality control is critical

3. **Timeline**: 8 hours (1 day)

**Document Status**: Requirements complete
**Work Item**: WI-123 (draft, priority 1)
**Next Action**: Design the 18 LLM standard rules
**Impact**: Prevents "this session's problems" from recurring
