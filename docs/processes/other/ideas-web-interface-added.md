## Features Demonstrated

### Voting System
```javascript
// Click upvote → POST /idea/<id>/vote
// Response updates vote count in UI
// No page reload (AJAX)
```

### Lifecycle Management
```python
idea → research → proposed → converted (to work item)
                           ↘ rejected (with reason)
```

### HTMX Integration
```html
<!-- Convert button loads form via HTMX -->
<button hx-get="/idea/{{ idea.id }}/convert-form"
        hx-target="#convert-modal-content"
        data-bs-toggle="modal">
    Convert to Work Item
</button>
```

### Filtering & Search
```
/ideas                          # All ideas
/ideas?status=proposed          # Only proposed
/ideas?tags=phase-2,high-value  # By tags
/ideas?sort=votes               # Sort by votes
```

## Usage Examples

### View All Ideas
```
http://localhost:5000/ideas
```

Shows:
- Summary metrics (total, by status)
- Popular tags cloud
- Filterable list of ideas
- Voting interface

### Filter by Phase
```
http://localhost:5000/ideas?tags=phase-2
```

Shows only Phase 2 ideas (high priority after Micro-MVP)

### Vote on Idea
```
Click "Upvote" button
→ AJAX POST to /idea/<id>/vote
→ Vote count updates (no reload)
```

### Convert Idea to Work Item
```
1. Click "Convert to Work Item"
2. Modal opens (HTMX loaded form)
3. Select type, edit name/description, set priority
4. Submit
5. New work item created
6. Idea status → 'converted'
7. Redirected to work item detail
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (After Ideas Interface Works)

**Test the interface:**
```bash
# Start Flask app
cd /Users/nigelcopley/.project_manager/aipm-v2
flask --app agentpm.web.app run

# Open browser
open http://localhost:5000/ideas

# Test:
- Can you see all 16 ideas?
- Can you filter by tags (phase-2, phase-3)?
- Can you upvote ideas?
- Can you convert an idea to work item?
```

### Validate LEAN Workflow

**Ideas → Work Items pipeline:**
```
1. Brainstorm idea (CLI or web)
2. Vote on ideas (web interface)
3. Research top-voted ideas
4. Propose for development
5. Convert to work item
6. Now it's committed work
```

**This supports LEAN:** Don't commit to work items until validated through ideas first

---

## Integration with Micro-MVP

**How Ideas support Micro-MVP strategy:**

1. **Current proposed work items** → Converted to ideas ✅
2. **Ideas visible in web** → Can vote/prioritize ✅
3. **Micro-MVP is only committed work item** → Focus maintained ✅
4. **If Micro-MVP succeeds** → Promote ideas to work items ✅
5. **If Micro-MVP fails** → Ideas stay as ideas ✅

**This is LEAN philosophy in practice:**
- Don't commit to building until validated
- Keep options visible but not committed
- Promote based on evidence, not speculation

---

## Summary

**Added:**
- 1 Flask blueprint (ideas.py)
- 6 routes (list, detail, vote, transition, convert-form, convert)
- 2 templates (ideas_list.html, idea_detail.html)
- 1 partial (idea_convert_form.html)
- 1 nav item (Ideas in main navigation)

**Features:**
- Voting system (upvote/downvote)
- Lifecycle transitions (idea → research → proposed → converted/rejected)
- Filtering (status, tags, sort)
- Tag cloud (popular tags)
- Convert to work item (HTMX modal)
- Status distribution metrics

**Status:** ✅ Ready to test
**Next:** Start Flask app and validate Ideas interface works

**Aligns with:** LEAN philosophy (ideas before commitment)

**Implementation Time:** ~45 minutes (1 blueprint, 3 templates)
**Testing:** Pending (start Flask app to validate)
