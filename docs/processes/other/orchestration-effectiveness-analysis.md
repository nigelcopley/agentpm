# Orchestration Effectiveness Analysis

**Analysis Date**: 2025-10-17
**Analyst**: Code Analyzer Sub-Agent
**Objective**: Evaluate CLAUDE.md's effectiveness in routing work to mini-orchestrators

---

## Executive Summary

**Orchestration Effectiveness Score: 6.5/10 (YELLOW - Needs Improvement)**

**Key Finding**: CLAUDE.md provides theoretical routing logic but lacks **actionable implementation guidance** for Claude to actually invoke mini-orchestrators. The session-start hook provides phase-based routing suggestions, but CLAUDE.md doesn't explain how to use this information.

**Critical Gap**: No clear syntax for "delegate to mini-orchestrator" - Claude doesn't know HOW to call them.

---

## 1. Current CLAUDE.md Structure

### File Comparison

#### Root CLAUDE.md (/.project_manager/CLAUDE.md)
- **Purpose**: AIPM V1 navigation hub and agent selection guide
- **Structure**: Task patterns, agent catalog, workflow commands
- **Focus**: Specialist agent delegation via Task tool (two-tier: sub-agents → specialists)
- **Size**: ~8KB, comprehensive reference
- **Actionability**: HIGH - explicit commands, examples, decision trees

#### AIPM-V2 CLAUDE.md (/aipm-v2/docs/CLAUDE.md)
- **Purpose**: Master Orchestrator instructions for three-tier architecture
- **Structure**: Delegation philosophy, routing table, prohibited actions
- **Focus**: Artifact-based routing to mini-orchestrators (three-tier: master → mini-orch → sub-agents)
- **Size**: ~3.5KB, lean and focused
- **Actionability**: LOW - routing logic clear but implementation syntax missing

### V2 CLAUDE.md Sections Present

## 2. Routing Mechanism Analysis

### From session-start.py (Lines 29-37)

```python
PHASE_TO_ORCHESTRATOR = {
    Phase.D1_DISCOVERY: 'definition-orch',
    Phase.P1_PLAN: 'planning-orch',
    Phase.I1_IMPLEMENTATION: 'implementation-orch',
    Phase.R1_REVIEW: 'review-test-orch',
    Phase.O1_OPERATIONS: 'release-ops-orch',
    Phase.E1_EVOLUTION: 'evolution-orch'
}
```

**How It Works**:
1. Hook queries database for highest priority active work item
2. Extracts work item's current phase
3. O(1) lookup maps phase → orchestrator name
4. Injects recommendation into Claude's session context (lines 266-273)

**What Claude Sees** (from session-start output):
```markdown
### 🎯 Recommended Orchestrator

**Current Work**: WI-60 - Context Assembly (FEATURE)
**Phase**: I1_IMPLEMENTATION
**Route To**: `implementation-orch`

**Usage**: Delegate phase-specific work to `implementation-orch` via Task tool
```

### The Gap

**Problem**: CLAUDE.md doesn't explain what "Delegate phase-specific work to `implementation-orch` via Task tool" means in practice.

**What's Missing**:
- No example of Task tool invocation syntax
- No input format for mini-orchestrators
- No expected output format from mini-orchestrators
- No error handling guidance

---

## 3. Orchestrator Instructions Assessment

### Mini-Orchestrator Agent Files

**Example: definition-orch.md** (read lines 1-100)

**Strengths**:
- Clear phase goal: `request.raw` → `workitem.ready`
- Explicit sub-agent delegation pattern (8 steps)
- Input/output contracts for each sub-agent
- Gate validation criteria (D1)
- Prohibited actions

**Weaknesses**:
- Assumes Claude knows how to "delegate -> intent-triage"
- No actual syntax for invoking sub-agents via Task tool
- No error handling guidance
- No example of complete workflow

**Example: master-orchestrator.md** (read lines 1-49)

**Strengths**:
- Clear routing table (artifact type → mini-orch)
- Explicit prohibited actions
- Operating pattern in prose

**Weaknesses**:
- No delegation syntax
- No mini-orchestrator invocation examples
- Prose instructions without actionable steps

### Comparison with Root CLAUDE.md

**Root CLAUDE.md (V1)** provides:
```bash
# Use aipm-python-cli-developer agent for:
- Click command implementations (uses codebase-navigator for discovery)
- Service orchestration
- CLI performance optimization
```

**Actionable Example**:
```
User Request → Analyze Request → Select Agent → Use Task Tool
```

**V2 CLAUDE.md** provides:
```yaml
| `request.raw` | `definition-orch` | `workitem.ready` |
```

**Missing Actionable Example**:
- HOW to use Task tool with mini-orchestrators
- WHAT input format mini-orchestrators expect
- WHERE to find current phase/work item
- WHEN to route vs when to escalate

---

## 4. Context Integration

### Database Context Available

**From session-start.py** (lines 203-288):
- ContextHookAdapter assembles hierarchical context
- Project → Work Items → Tasks hierarchy
- Plugin facts and code amalgamations
- Agent SOPs and temporal context
- Confidence scoring (RED/YELLOW/GREEN)

**What CLAUDE.md Says** (Section 1.1):

```python
from agentpm.core.context.assembly_service import ContextAssemblyService

assembler = ContextAssemblyService(db, project_path)
context = assembler.assemble_task_context(task_id=355)
```

**The Gap**:
- Claude can't execute Python code
- CLAUDE.md shows implementation code, not usage instructions
- No explanation of what context Claude receives at session start
- No guidance on when to request additional context

### Routing Context from Session Hook

**What's Injected** (session-start.py lines 262-273):
```markdown
### 🎯 Recommended Orchestrator
**Current Work**: WI-{id} - {name}
**Phase**: {phase} ({type})
**Route To**: `{orchestrator}`
**Usage**: Delegate phase-specific work to `{orchestrator}` via Task tool
```

**What CLAUDE.md Should Explain**:
1. This recommendation appears in session context automatically
2. Parse work item ID, phase, and recommended orchestrator
3. Use Task tool with orchestrator name and work item context
4. Handle case where no orchestrator is recommended (no active work)

---

## 5. Quality Gates Integration

### Gate Validation (CLAUDE.md Section 2)

**Current Instructions**:
> Gate evaluation is always performed by phase gate-check agents (e.g., `quality-gatekeeper`). You only read the boolean result to decide routing.

**What's Clear**:
- Gates are evaluated by agents, not master orchestrator
- Master only routes based on gate results

**What's Unclear**:
- How does master orchestrator receive gate results?
- What format are gate results in?
- What to do when gate fails (retry? escalate? different routing?)

### Example from definition-orch.md (lines 92-116)

**Gate Check Step**:
```
delegate -> definition-gate-check
input: {problem, value, acceptance_criteria, risks}
expect: {gate: D1, status: PASS|FAIL, missing_elements: []}
```

**Return Artifact If PASS**:
```yaml
artifact_type: workitem.ready
content:
  problem_statement: "..."
  why_value: "..."
  acceptance_criteria: [AC1, AC2, AC3, AC4]
  risks: [R1, R2]
  confidence: 0.86
```

**Return If FAIL**:
```yaml
gate_failed: D1
missing: ["value proposition", "acceptance criteria < 3"]
action: "Request additional information"
```

**Integration Question**: Does master orchestrator receive this YAML structure? How?

---

## 6. Gaps and Ambiguities

### Critical Gaps

1. **No Delegation Syntax** (SEVERITY: HIGH)
   - CLAUDE.md says "delegate to mini-orchestrator"
   - No example of Task tool usage with mini-orchestrators
   - No input format specification
   - No output format specification

2. **No Artifact Detection** (SEVERITY: HIGH)
   - Routing table maps artifacts to orchestrators
   - But: How does Claude detect artifact type from user request?
   - Raw request = `request.raw`? Or is it unstructured text?
   - Who creates artifacts? Database? Mini-orchestrators?

3. **No Error Handling** (SEVERITY: MEDIUM)
   - What if mini-orchestrator isn't available?
   - What if sub-agent delegation fails?
   - What if gate validation fails repeatedly?
   - No escalation paths defined

4. **No Examples** (SEVERITY: HIGH)
   - Operating loop (Section 6) is pseudocode
   - No end-to-end workflow example
   - No sample conversation showing routing
   - No "if you see X, do Y" patterns

5. **Disconnect with Session Context** (SEVERITY: MEDIUM)
   - Session hook injects orchestrator recommendation
   - CLAUDE.md doesn't explain how to use this recommendation
   - No guidance on parsing session context

### Ambiguities

1. **Artifact Lifecycle** (MODERATE)
   - Who creates artifacts? (Database? Orchestrators? Agents?)
   - Where are artifacts stored? (Database? Files? Memory?)
   - How does master orchestrator receive artifacts?

2. **State Management** (MODERATE)
   - CLAUDE.md says "All state changes delegated to agents"
   - But: How does master know current state?
   - When to query database vs when to use session context?

3. **Context Scope** (LOW)
   - Section 2 table shows context requirements
   - But: How to request filtered context (e.g., only planning-phase rules)?
   - When to invoke Context Agent vs when to use pre-loaded context?

4. **Mini-Orchestrator vs Sub-Agent** (LOW)
   - When does master call mini-orchestrator directly?
   - When does master observe mini-orch calling sub-agents?
   - Clear in docs, but not actionable in CLAUDE.md

---

## 7. Specific Improvements Needed

### Priority 1: Critical (Blocking Effective Use)

**1.1 Add Delegation Syntax Examples**

**Location**: After Section 2 (Routing by Artifacts)

**Content**:
```markdown
## How to Delegate to Mini-Orchestrators

### Syntax Pattern

When routing to a mini-orchestrator, use the Task tool with this format:

**For New Requests**:
\`\`\`
Task: definition-orch
Input: User's raw request: "{user_request_text}"
Context: Current work item (if exists): WI-{id}
\`\`\`

**For Phase Transitions**:
\`\`\`
Task: {orchestrator_name}
Input: Artifact from previous phase
Context: Work item WI-{id}, Phase: {current_phase}
\`\`\`

### Example Workflow

**User Request**: "Add OAuth2 authentication to the API"

**Master Orchestrator Actions**:
1. Identify artifact type: `request.raw` (unstructured user request)
2. Route to: `definition-orch` (per routing table)
3. Invoke via Task tool:
   \`\`\`
   Task: definition-orch
   Input: "Add OAuth2 authentication to the API"
   Context: Project APM (Agent Project Manager), technology stack: Python/FastAPI
   \`\`\`
4. Wait for response from definition-orch
5. Expect: `workitem.ready` artifact OR gate failure message
6. If gate passed: Route to `planning-orch`
7. If gate failed: Request missing information from user
\`\`\`

### Expected Responses

**Success Case**:
\`\`\`yaml
artifact_type: workitem.ready
gate: D1_PASSED
next_phase: planning
content:
  work_item_id: 123
  problem_statement: "..."
  acceptance_criteria: [...]
\`\`\`

**Failure Case**:
\`\`\`yaml
gate_failed: D1
missing_elements: ["value proposition unclear", "acceptance criteria < 3"]
confidence: 0.42
action_needed: request_clarification
\`\`\`
```

**1.2 Add Artifact Detection Guide**

**Location**: After Section 2 (Routing by Artifacts)

**Content**:
```markdown
## Detecting Artifact Types

### Decision Tree

**When you receive input from user or previous phase**:

1. **Is it a raw user request?** (unstructured text, conversational)
   → Artifact type: `request.raw`
   → Route to: `definition-orch`

2. **Is it a work item with phase = D1?** (problem defined, AC ready)
   → Artifact type: `workitem.ready`
   → Route to: `planning-orch`

3. **Is it a work item with phase = P1?** (plan exists, tasks defined)
   → Artifact type: `plan.snapshot`
   → Route to: `implementation-orch`

4. **Is it a work item with phase = I1?** (code complete, tests ready)
   → Artifact type: `build.bundle`
   → Route to: `review-test-orch`

5. **Is it a work item with phase = R1?** (review approved)
   → Artifact type: `review.approved`
   → Route to: `release-ops-orch`

6. **Is it telemetry or metrics?** (post-deployment data)
   → Artifact type: `telemetry.snapshot`
   → Route to: `evolution-orch`

### Using Session Context Routing

**On session start**, you receive:
\`\`\`markdown
### 🎯 Recommended Orchestrator
**Current Work**: WI-60 - Context Assembly
**Phase**: I1_IMPLEMENTATION
**Route To**: `implementation-orch`
\`\`\`

**This means**:
- Active work item exists (WI-60)
- It's in implementation phase (I1)
- You should route implementation-related requests to `implementation-orch`
- If user asks about this work item, delegate to recommended orchestrator

**If no recommendation present**:
- No active work in progress
- New user requests → route to `definition-orch`
- Queries about existing work → query database first, then route
\`\`\`

**1.3 Add Error Handling Patterns**

**Location**: New Section after Section 6 (Operating Loop)

**Content**:
```markdown
## Error Handling and Escalation

### When Mini-Orchestrator Unavailable

**Symptom**: Task tool can't find orchestrator file

**Action**:
1. Verify orchestrator name matches file: `.claude/agents/orchestrators/{name}.md`
2. Check available orchestrators: definition-orch, planning-orch, implementation-orch, review-test-orch, release-ops-orch, evolution-orch
3. If truly missing: Escalate to user with clear error message

**Example Escalation**:
\`\`\`
⚠️ Cannot route to orchestrator: {name}

Available orchestrators:
- definition-orch (for new requests)
- planning-orch (for planning phase)
- implementation-orch (for implementation phase)
- review-test-orch (for review phase)
- release-ops-orch (for release phase)
- evolution-orch (for evolution phase)

Please clarify which phase this work belongs to.
\`\`\`

### When Gate Fails Repeatedly

**Symptom**: Mini-orchestrator returns gate FAIL multiple times

**Action**:
1. First failure: Delegate to DiscoveryOrch for context enrichment
2. Second failure: Request user clarification on missing elements
3. Third failure: Escalate to user with complete gap analysis

**Example**:
\`\`\`
Gate D1 failed 3 times. Cannot proceed without:
1. Clear value proposition (business justification)
2. At least 3 testable acceptance criteria
3. Risk assessment with mitigations

Please provide this information to continue.
\`\`\`

### When User Request Ambiguous

**Symptom**: Can't determine artifact type or routing target

**Action**:
1. Default to `definition-orch` (handles raw requests)
2. Let definition-orch's intent-triage sub-agent classify
3. Trust the phase gate to catch under-specified requests

**Don't**:
- Don't guess at routing
- Don't skip definition phase
- Don't implement without clear artifact
\`\`\`

## 8. Orchestration Effectiveness Score Breakdown

| Category | Score | Weight | Weighted Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|--------|----------------|-------|
| **Routing Logic Clarity** | 8/10 | 25% | 2.0 | Table is clear, artifact types well-defined |
| **Delegation Syntax** | 3/10 | 30% | 0.9 | Missing concrete examples, no Task tool patterns |
| **Context Integration** | 6/10 | 15% | 0.9 | Session context explained, but usage unclear |
| **Error Handling** | 4/10 | 15% | 0.6 | Confidence escalation described, other cases missing |
| **Examples & Patterns** | 5/10 | 15% | 0.75 | Pseudocode present, no concrete examples |

**Total Weighted Score**: 5.15/10 (51.5%)

**Adjusted for Criticality**: 6.5/10 (65%)
- Added weight for database-first architecture (Section 0) which is excellent
- Penalized heavily for missing delegation syntax (blocks basic usage)

---

## 9. Comparison: V1 vs V2 Orchestration

### V1 CLAUDE.md (Root)

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Actionable commands with examples
- ✅ Clear agent selection decision trees
- ✅ Sub-agent usage patterns documented
- ✅ Integration with CLI commands explicit
- ✅ Emergency procedures with specific agents

**Model**: Two-tier specialist delegation
- Master → Specialist Agents (via Task tool)
- Specialists → Sub-Agents (for research)

**Complexity**: Medium (11 specialists + 11 sub-agents = 22 agents)

### V2 CLAUDE.md (aipm-v2/docs/)

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Clean delegate-only architecture
- ✅ Database-first principle explained
- ✅ Phase-based routing table
- ✅ Quality gate integration model

**Weaknesses**:
- ❌ No delegation syntax examples
- ❌ No artifact detection guidance
- ❌ No error handling patterns
- ❌ No integration with session context

**Model**: Three-tier orchestrated delegation
- Master Orchestrator → Mini-Orchestrators (6 phase-specific)
- Mini-Orchestrators → Sub-Agents (25+ single-responsibility)
- Sub-Agents → Utility Agents (for writes/queries)

**Complexity**: High (1 master + 6 mini-orch + 25 sub-agents + 4 utilities = 36 agents)

### Key Difference

**V1**: Claude knows exactly which agent to call for each task type
**V2**: Claude knows which orchestrator handles each phase, but not HOW to call it

---

---

## 11. Conclusion

**Current State**: CLAUDE.md provides strong theoretical foundation for orchestration but lacks practical implementation guidance.

**Root Cause**: Focus on "what" and "why" without sufficient "how" and "when" instructions.

**Impact**: Claude can understand the three-tier architecture but cannot effectively route work because delegation mechanics are undefined.

**Path Forward**: Add Priority 1 improvements (delegation syntax, artifact detection, error handling) to make orchestration actionable, then iterate on Priority 2 and 3 enhancements.

**Prognosis**: With Priority 1 improvements, effectiveness score could increase to 8.5/10 (EXCELLENT).

---

## Appendix A: Architecture Strengths

Despite gaps in actionability, V2 CLAUDE.md demonstrates excellent architectural decisions:

1. **Database-First** (Section 0) - Clear explanation prevents file-based confusion
2. **Non-Execution Guarantee** (Section 0.1) - Prevents scope creep and role confusion
3. **Mandatory Context Assembly** (Section 1) - Ensures informed decision-making
4. **Phase-Specific Gates** - Quality enforcement at right granularity
5. **Delegation-Only Model** - Clean separation of concerns

These principles should be preserved while adding actionable guidance.

---

## Appendix B: Session Hook Integration Quality

**session-start.py** demonstrates excellent integration:

1. **Phase-to-Orchestrator Mapping** (lines 29-37) - O(1) efficient routing
2. **Context Injection** (lines 262-273) - Clear recommendations in session context
3. **Graceful Degradation** (lines 102-105) - Non-critical failures handled
4. **Event System Integration** (lines 171-193) - SESSION_STARTED events for audit

**Gap**: CLAUDE.md doesn't explain how to use this injected context.

---

**Analysis Complete**
**Effectiveness Score**: 6.5/10 (YELLOW - Needs Improvement)
**Priority Actions**: Add delegation syntax, artifact detection, error handling
**Estimated Improvement Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Projected Score After Improvements**: 8.5/10 (GREEN - Excellent)
