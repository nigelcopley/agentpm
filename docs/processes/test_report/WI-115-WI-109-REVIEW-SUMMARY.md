## Known Issues (Follow-Up Tasks Needed)

### Unrelated to WI-115/WI-109
These issues were discovered during review but are NOT blockers:

1. **Migration 0027 not applied** (2 test failures)
   - Severity: Medium
   - Impact: Test infrastructure only
   - Action: Create separate bugfix task

2. **Skills command import error**
   - Error: `cannot import name 'SkillType'`
   - Impact: Skills command unavailable
   - Action: Create separate bugfix task

3. **Test module path issues** (2 files)
   - Files: `test_document_add_path_guidance.py`, `test_document_migrate_helpers.py`
   - Impact: Test collection errors
   - Action: Create separate bugfix task

4. **Documentation cleanup** (WI-115 detected drift)
   - 20 files with Python syntax errors
   - 7 files with unclosed code blocks
   - Impact: Low (tests are working correctly by detecting this)
   - Action: Create separate cleanup task (4-6 hours)

## Follow-Up Actions

### Immediate (Today)
1. ✅ Approve WI-115
2. ✅ Approve WI-109
3. ✅ Close both work items

### This Week
1. Create bugfix task for migration 0027 issue
2. Create bugfix task for skills command import error
3. Create bugfix task for test module path issues
4. Create cleanup task for documentation drift (20 files)

### Next 2 Weeks
1. Enable CI/CD documentation tests in WARNING mode
2. Monitor test results
3. Fix documentation drift issues
4. Enable BLOCKING mode

## Risk Assessment

### WI-115 Risks
- **Risk**: Documentation drift increases over time
- **Mitigation**: CI/CD pipeline now catches drift
- **Severity**: LOW

### WI-109 Risks
- **Risk**: Import errors re-introduced
- **Mitigation**: 34 tests prevent regression
- **Severity**: VERY LOW

### Overall Risk
**COMBINED RISK**: **LOW** - Both work items have strong regression prevention.
