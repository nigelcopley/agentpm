    - "execute (actual cleanup)"
    - "verify (validation mode)"

  script_features_implemented:
    - "Boilerplate pattern detection"
    - "JSON metadata parsing"
    - "Database updates with error handling"
    - "Comprehensive reporting"
    - "Dry-run safety mode"

# Boilerplate Patterns Detected and Removed
boilerplate_patterns_removed:
  - "Users can filter results by at least five dimensions"
  - "Filter selections persist across refresh and new sessions"
  - "API returns results within 400ms p95 under load"
  - "Tailwind config exposes utilities and component classes"
  - "Smart filter JS unchanged and compatible"
  - "Outline core modules, data flow, and performance considerations for implementing the filters service"

# Technical Details
technical_implementation:
  language: "Python 3"
  database: "SQLite via DatabaseService"
  pattern_matching: "String matching on acceptance_criteria and technical_approach fields"
  update_strategy: "SET quality_metadata = '{}' WHERE id IN (...)"
  verification_strategy: "COUNT(*) queries with CASE statements"

# Testing Summary
testing:
  manual_testing:
    - "Dry-run mode tested and verified"
    - "Execute mode tested with 31 tasks"
    - "Verify mode confirms cleanup success"
    - "Sample queries confirm empty metadata"

  test_cases_covered:
    - "Detect boilerplate in JSON metadata"
    - "Handle both string and dict acceptance criteria"

# Lessons Learned
lessons_learned:
  - "Boilerplate detection via pattern matching is effective for known patterns"
  - "Dry-run mode is essential for safe database operations"
  - "Verification queries provide confidence in cleanup success"
  - "Empty metadata ('{}') is better than misleading boilerplate"
  - "Script approach (vs manual SQL) provides better audit trail and safety"

# Time Tracking
time_tracking:
  estimated_effort: "2.0 hours"
  actual_effort: "0.25 hours (15 minutes)"
  efficiency: "8x faster than estimated"
  reason: "Option A (reset) much simpler than Option B (smart cleanup)"
