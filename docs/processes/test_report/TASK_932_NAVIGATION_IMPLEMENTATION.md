## Files Modified

### `/Users/nigelcopley/.project_manager/aipm-v2/agentpm/web/templates/components/layout/header.html`

**Changes**:
1. Replaced flat navigation with dropdown menus
2. Added Alpine.js state management for dropdowns
3. Implemented mobile navigation with sections
4. Added keyboard shortcuts modal
5. Updated quick actions bar

**Key Improvements**:
- Better organization (logical grouping)
- Scalable structure (easy to add more routes)
- Consistent with modern web patterns
- Mobile-first design
- Keyboard-accessible

## Route Status Summary

### Working Routes (9)
- `/` - Dashboard
- `/work-items` - Work Items list
- `/tasks` - Tasks list
- `/projects` - Projects list
- `/agents` - Agents list
- `/rules` - Rules list
- `/ideas` - Ideas list
- `/search` - Search page

### Routes with Backend Issues (5)
These routes are accessible via navigation but return HTTP 500 errors:
- `/contexts` - Contexts list (likely database query issue)
- `/sessions` - Sessions list (likely missing data)
- `/research/documents` - Documents research (not yet implemented)
- `/research/evidence` - Evidence research (not yet implemented)
- `/research/events` - Events research (not yet implemented)

**Recommendation**: Create separate tasks to fix backend issues for these routes.

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ **All 14 routes accessible from navigation**
- Desktop: 4 dropdown menus + 1 standalone link
- Mobile: Organized sections with all routes

✅ **Logical organization (grouped dropdowns)**
- Work: Work management items
- System: Configuration and rules
- Research: Knowledge and documentation
- Sessions: Activity tracking

✅ **Mobile navigation complete**
- Section headers for organization
- Icons for visual clarity
- Active state indicators
- Responsive behavior

✅ **Keyboard shortcuts reference**
- ⌘K for search
- ? for help modal
- Help modal with quick links and tips

## Technical Details

### Alpine.js Integration
- Dropdown state management: `x-data="{ open: false }"`
- Click away handling: `@click.away="open = false"`
- Transitions: `x-transition` for smooth open/close
- Modal state: `helpModalOpen` in header controller

### Responsive Design
- Desktop: Dropdown menus with rounded pills
- Mobile: Full-screen menu with sections
- Breakpoint: `md:` (768px)

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA attributes (`aria-expanded`)
- Keyboard navigation (Escape to close)
- Focus management
- Semantic HTML

## Usage Examples

### Desktop Navigation
1. Hover over dropdown button (Work, System, Research)
2. Click to open dropdown
3. Click menu item to navigate
4. Click away to close

### Mobile Navigation
1. Click hamburger menu (top right)
2. Scroll through organized sections
3. Tap menu item to navigate
4. Tap outside to close

### Keyboard Shortcuts
1. Press `⌘K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) to focus search
2. Press `?` to show keyboard shortcuts help
3. Press `Escape` to close help modal

## Next Steps

### Recommended Follow-up Tasks

1. **Fix Backend Routes** (Priority: High)
   - Fix `/contexts` route (HTTP 500)
   - Fix `/sessions` route (HTTP 500)
   - Implement `/research/*` routes or remove from navigation

2. **Enhanced Search** (Priority: Medium)
   - Implement scoped search (work items only, tasks only, etc.)
   - Add search filters
   - Add recent searches

3. **Keyboard Shortcuts Expansion** (Priority: Low)
   - Add more shortcuts (e.g., `G W` for work items, `G T` for tasks)
   - Implement quick create (⌘N)
   - Add command palette (⌘P)

4. **User Menu Enhancements** (Priority: Low)
   - Implement notifications panel
   - Add user profile section
   - Add theme switcher (light/dark mode)

## Design System Compliance

✅ Uses Tailwind CSS utilities
✅ Consistent with existing design patterns
✅ Bootstrap Icons for all menu items
✅ Primary color (`text-primary`, `bg-primary/10`)
✅ Hover states and transitions
✅ Responsive breakpoints

## Testing Notes

### Manual Testing Performed
- ✓ Desktop navigation dropdowns work correctly
- ✓ Mobile navigation opens and closes
- ✓ All working routes navigate successfully
- ✓ Active state indicators highlight current page
- ✓ Keyboard shortcuts function correctly
- ✓ Help modal displays and closes properly

### Browser Compatibility
Tested on:
- Chrome (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Firefox (latest)

### Known Issues
1. Some routes return HTTP 500 (backend issues, not navigation issues)
2. Contexts, Sessions, and Research routes need backend fixes

## Summary

Task 932 is **COMPLETE**. All acceptance criteria have been met:
- All 14 enhanced routes are accessible through navigation
- Logical organization with dropdown menus
- Mobile navigation is complete and organized
- Keyboard shortcuts reference implemented

Backend route issues (HTTP 500 errors) are separate concerns and should be addressed in follow-up tasks.
