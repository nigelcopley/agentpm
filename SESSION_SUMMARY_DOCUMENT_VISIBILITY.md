├── reference/           # API docs, specifications
└── processes/           # Migration/integration guides
```

### Visibility Policy Matrix

**40+ document types** categorized by visibility:
- **Always Private**: Planning, Governance, Operations, Communication
- **Always Public**: Guides (user/developer/admin), Reference (API docs)
- **Context-Aware**: Architecture, Processes (depends on audience)

### Context-Aware Scoring (0-100)

Considers:
- **Team Size**: solo | small (2-5) | medium (6-20) | large (20+)
- **Dev Stage**: development | staging | production
- **Collaboration**: private | internal | open_source
- **Lifecycle**: draft | review | published | archived

**Score determines placement**:
- 0-40: private (`.agentpm/docs/`)
- 40-60: restricted (team only)
- 60-100: public (`docs/`)

### Publishing Workflow

```
draft (private) → review → approved → published (public copy) → archived
```

**CLI Commands**:
- `apm document submit-review <id>`
- `apm document approve <id>`
- `apm document publish <id>` - Copies to public docs/
- `apm document unpublish <id>` - Removes from public
- `apm document sync` - Sync all published docs
- `apm document set-visibility <id>` - Change policy

## 📊 Problem → Solution

### Current State (Problems)
- ❌ 555 orphaned files (not in database)
- ❌ Inconsistent file naming/locations
- ❌ No visibility policy (all docs in one place)
- ❌ Agents bypass `apm document add`
- ❌ No document lifecycle management
- ❌ No audit trail
- ❌ Violates database-first architecture

### Target State (Solution)
- ✅ 100% docs tracked in database (0 orphaned)
- ✅ Automatic file path generation (<100ms)
- ✅ Context-aware public/private placement
- ✅ All agents use `apm document add` (DOC-020 enforced)
- ✅ Full lifecycle: draft→review→published
- ✅ Complete audit trail
- ✅ Database-first architecture respected

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Database-First Architecture
The document system now properly follows APM's core principle: **database is source of truth, not files**. All document metadata lives in database, files are generated artifacts.

### 2. Context-Aware Intelligence
Visibility isn't binary (public/private). The system adapts to:
- Team structure (solo vs large team)
- Development stage (dev vs production)
- Collaboration model (private vs open source)
- Document lifecycle (draft vs published)

### 3. Separation of Concerns
Clear distinction between:
- **Internal docs** (`.agentpm/docs/`): Planning, operations, governance
- **External docs** (`docs/`): Guides, references, public-facing content

### 4. Automated Compliance
DOC-020 rule + validator ensures agents can't bypass the system. Automated detection and remediation.

### 5. Lifecycle Management
Documents aren't static. They flow through states (draft→review→published→archived) with proper audit trails.
