    Find nearest .aipm project directory by walking up the tree.

    Similar to git's .git directory detection. Starts from current directory
    or specified path and walks up the tree until finding an .aipm directory

    Args:
        start_path: Starting directory (defaults to current working directory)

    Returns:
        Path to project root containing .aipm directory, or None if not found

    Example:

        >>> # Returns /path/to/project (if .aipm exists there)
