"""
Service Factory - Centralized service initialization with caching

Provides lazy-initialized, cached service instances for database, workflow,
and context operations. Single source of truth for service configuration.

Benefits:
- Caching prevents redundant database connections (1 per project)
- Consistent error handling across all commands
- Easy to mock for testing
- Lazy initialization (services created only when needed)

def get_database_service(project_root: Path) -> DatabaseService:
    """
    Get or create database service (cached per project).

    Uses LRU cache to ensure only one DatabaseService instance per project.
    This prevents multiple database connections and ensures consistent state.

    Args:
        project_root: Path to project root containing .agentpm directory

    Returns:
        DatabaseService instance

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If database file doesn't exist (project not initialized)

    Performance:
        - First call: ~50ms (database connection + schema validation)
        - Subsequent calls: <1ms (cache hit)

    Example:
        ```python
        db = get_database_service(Path("/path/to/project"))
        tasks = db.tasks.list_tasks()
        ```

    Get workflow service with database dependency.

    Creates WorkflowService instance with cached DatabaseService.
    No caching on WorkflowService itself (lightweight wrapper).

    Args:
        project_root: Path to project root

    Returns:
        WorkflowService instance for quality gate operations

    Example:
        ```python

    Get context service with database and path dependencies.

    Creates ContextService instance with cached DatabaseService and project path.
    No caching on ContextService itself (stateless operations).

    Args:
        project_root: Path to project root

    Returns:
        ContextService instance for context assembly and scoring

    Example:
        ```python
        context_svc = get_context_service(project_root)
        context = context_svc.get_task_context(task_id=123)
