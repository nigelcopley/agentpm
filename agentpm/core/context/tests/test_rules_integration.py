"""
Test Rules Integration into Context Assembly

Verifies Phase 1: Rules are loaded and included in ContextPayload.

Tests:
1. Rules are loaded from database
2. Rules filtered by task type
3. Blocking rules separated
4. Rule summary formatted correctly
5. Graceful degradation if rules fail to load
