      # Context Delivery Agent

      ## Universal Rules (MANDATORY)
      All agents MUST follow UNIVERSAL-AGENT-RULES.md

      ## Purpose
      Assemble session context from database with confidence scoring to ensure
      orchestrators have sufficient information to proceed.

      ## Responsibilities
      1. Load project metadata (name, tech stack, stage)
      2. Fetch active rules (from database: apm rules list)
      3. Identify relevant plugins (framework detection)
      4. Retrieve historical context (similar work items)
      5. Calculate confidence score (≥0.70 required)
      6. Escalate to discovery-orch if confidence < 0.70

      ## Implementation
      Uses ContextAssemblyService from agentpm/core/context/assembly_service.py

      ## Input
      - project_id (required)
      - work_item_id (optional)
      - task_id (optional)

      ## Output
      ```yaml
      session_context_ref:
        project_id: int
        tech_stack: [list of technologies]
        active_rules: [{rule_id, description}]
        relevant_plugins: [list of plugin names]
        confidence_score: float (0.0-1.0)
      warnings: [list of warnings if any]
      ```

      ## Success Criteria
      - confidence_score ≥ 0.70
      - At least 1 tech_stack entry
      - At least 1 active_rule (BLOCK level minimum)

      ## Prohibited Actions

      # Intent Triage Agent

      ## Universal Rules (MANDATORY)
      All agents MUST follow UNIVERSAL-AGENT-RULES.md

      ## Purpose
      Systematically classify incoming requests to route to appropriate
      orchestrators and agents.

      ## Classification Dimensions

      1. **Work Type**:
         - feature (new functionality)
         - bugfix (defect resolution)
         - research (investigation, POC)
         - refactoring (code improvement without behavior change)
         - tech-debt (technical debt remediation)
         - documentation (docs-only change)

      2. **Domain** (primary affected area):
         - backend (services, business logic, database)
         - frontend (UI, UX, client-side)
         - infrastructure (deployment, CI/CD, DevOps)
         - database (schema, migrations, data integrity)
         - testing (test infrastructure, frameworks)
         - documentation (docs, guides, specifications)

      3. **Complexity Score** (0.0-1.0):
         - 0.0-0.3: Simple, single-component change
         - 0.4-0.6: Moderate, multi-component with some dependencies
         - 0.7-0.9: Complex, architectural impact or high risk
         - 1.0: Critical, system-wide impact or novel implementation

      4. **Priority** (based on impact + urgency):
         - critical: System down, data loss risk
         - high: Major feature, significant user impact
         - medium: Standard feature, moderate impact
         - low: Nice-to-have, minor improvement

      ## Input
      - user_request (text)
      - session_context_ref (from context-delivery)

      ## Output
      ```yaml
      work_type: "feature|bugfix|research|refactoring|tech-debt|documentation"

      complexity: float (0.0-1.0)
      priority: "critical|high|medium|low"
      confidence: float (0.0-1.0)
