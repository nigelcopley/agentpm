"""
Database CRUD Methods

Type-safe CRUD operations for all entity types.

Each method module follows the pattern:
- Accepts Pydantic models as input
- Returns Pydantic models as output
- Uses adapters for model ï¿½ database conversion
- Validates dependencies before creation

Usage:
    from agentpm.core.database.methods import projects, work_items, tasks

    project = projects.create_project(service, Project(name="AIPM", path="/path"))
    work_item = work_items.create_work_item(service, WorkItem(...))
