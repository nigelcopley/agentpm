Migration 0045: Add Review Timestamp Columns

Adds missing review timestamp columns to the document_references table.

This migration adds:
1. reviewer_assigned_at TIMESTAMP column to track when a reviewer was assigned
2. review_completed_at TIMESTAMP column to track when review was completed

Background:
- Migration 0044 added reviewer_id, review_status, and review_comment
- However, reviewer_assigned_at and review_completed_at were missing from the schema
- These columns are needed to track the full review lifecycle timestamps

Task: #1109 - Create Migration for Review Timestamp Columns
