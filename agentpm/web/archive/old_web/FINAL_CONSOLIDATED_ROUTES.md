## "Less is More" with Task Detail Routes

This is the final, consolidated route structure that balances comprehensive views with necessary detail routes for tasks.

## Key Design Decisions

### ✅ **Work Items - Balanced Approach:**
- **Work Item Detail**: Comprehensive view with tasks list, dependencies, context, summaries
- **Task Detail**: Separate route for task-specific information (dependencies, context, etc.)
- **Rationale**: Tasks have their own complex dependencies and context that deserve dedicated views

### ✅ **Ideas - Fully Consolidated:**
- **Idea Detail**: Single comprehensive view with elements, context, relationships
- **Rationale**: Ideas are simpler entities that can be fully consolidated

### ✅ **Context - Simplified Lists:**
- **Context Overview**: Comprehensive overview with all context types
- **Type Lists**: Simple lists for documents, evidence, events, sessions
- **Rationale**: Context items are typically viewed in lists, not individual details

### ✅ **Agents & Rules - Fully Consolidated:**
- **Detail Views**: Single comprehensive views with all related information
- **Rationale**: These entities have rich metadata that works well in consolidated views

## Final Route Statistics

### By Blueprint
- **Dashboard**: 4 routes
- **Ideas**: 2 routes
- **Work Items**: 3 routes
- **Context**: 5 routes
- **Agents**: 2 routes
- **Rules**: 2 routes
- **System**: 6 routes
- **Search**: 2 routes

### By HTTP Method
- **GET**: 26 routes (all routes are read-only)

### Total Routes: 26 (vs 40 in original version - 35% reduction)

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ **User Experience:**
1. **Balanced Navigation** - Consolidated where appropriate, detailed where needed
2. **Task Focus** - Tasks get their own detail views for complex dependencies
3. **Reduced Complexity** - 37.5% fewer routes to navigate
4. **Better Context** - Related information grouped together

### ✅ **Development:**
1. **Fewer Routes** - 25 vs 40 routes
2. **Simpler Navigation** - Less complex routing logic
3. **Easier Maintenance** - Fewer templates and route handlers
4. **Better Performance** - Fewer HTTP requests

### ✅ **Template Design:**
1. **Tabbed Interfaces** - Use tabs within detail views
2. **Task Detail Pages** - Dedicated pages for task complexity
3. **Accordion Layouts** - Collapsible sections for different data types
4. **Responsive Design** - Better mobile experience

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1 (Essential Views - 14 routes)
- Dashboard (4 routes)
- Ideas (2 routes)
- Work Items (3 routes)
- Agents (2 routes)
- Rules (2 routes)
- System health/database (2 routes)

### Phase 2 (Detailed Views - 12 routes)
- Context (5 routes)
- System files/logs/metrics (4 routes)
- Search (2 routes)
- System settings (1 route)

## Template Structure

### Work Item Detail Template
```
/work-items/<id>
├── Work Item Information
├── Tasks List (with links to /work-items/<id>/tasks/<task_id>)
├── Dependencies (visual and list)
├── Context (6W framework)
├── Summaries (progress, decisions, etc.)
├── Related Ideas
├── Agent Assignments
└── Timeline and History
```

### Task Detail Template
```
/work-items/<id>/tasks/<task_id>
├── Task Information
├── Task Dependencies (visual and list)
├── Task Context (6W framework)
├── Task Summaries (progress, decisions, etc.)
├── Agent Assignments
├── Timeline and History
└── Related Work Item Context
```

## Next Steps

1. **Design Comprehensive Templates** - Create tabbed/sectioned detail views
2. **Implement Task Detail Templates** - Create dedicated task detail pages
3. **Update Navigation** - Simplify navigation to match consolidated structure
4. **Test All Views** - Ensure all consolidated views work properly
5. **Add Interactivity Later** - When ready, add actions within consolidated views

**Note**: This final consolidated approach provides the right balance between comprehensive views and necessary detail routes, ensuring tasks get the attention they deserve while keeping the overall navigation simple and efficient.
